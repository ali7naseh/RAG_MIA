This immediately jeopardized the completion of course content at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus. This article presents effective teaching and examination strategies that can be utilized in teaching undergraduates during COVID-19 school restrictions. The introductory digital electronics course of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of the West Indies will be utilized to demonstrate the merits of these strategies. The research will focus on demonstrating that the teaching methodologies utilized avoided the student performance from degrading below what has been experienced in the past 5 academic years. Student feedback on the methodology utilized is also incorporated in this article to highlight key benefits gained by students.",

        "text": "A better understanding of the seroprevalence and specificity of influenza HA stem-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in the human population could significantly inform influenza vaccine design efforts. Here, we utilized probes comprising headless, HA stabilized stem (SS) to determine the prevalence, binding and neutralization breadth of antibodies directed to HA stem-epitope in a cross-sectional analysis of the general population. Five group-1 HA SS probes, representing five subtypes, were chosen for this analyses. Eighty-four percent of samples analyzed had specific reactivity to at least one probe, with approximately 60% of the samples reactive to H1 probes, and up to 45% reactive to each of the non-circulating subtypes. Thirty percent of analyzed sera had cross-reactivity to at least four of five probes and this reactivity could be blocked by competing with F10 bNAb. Binding cross-reactivity in sera samples significantly correlated with frequency of H1(+)H5(+) cross-reactive B cells. Interestingly, only 33% of the cross-reactive sera neutralized both H1N1 and H5N1 pseudoviruses. Cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies were more prevalent in individuals >50 years of age. Our data demonstrate the need to use multiple HA-stem probes to assess for broadly reactive antibodies. Further, a universal vaccine could be designed to boost pre-existing B-cells expressing stem-directed bNAbs.",
