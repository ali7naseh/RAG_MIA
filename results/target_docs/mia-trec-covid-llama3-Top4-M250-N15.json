        "title": "Targeting of Moloney murine leukemia virus gag precursor to the site of virus budding",
        "text": "Retrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) matures by budding at the cell surface. Central to the budding process is the myristoylated viral core protein precursor Gag which, even in the absence of all other viral components, is capable of associating with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and assembling into extracellular virus- like particles. In this paper we have used heterologous, Semliki Forest virus-driven, expression of M-MuLV Gag to study the mechanism by which this protein is targeted to the cell surface. In pulse-chase experiments, BFA, monensin, and 20 degrees C block did not affect incorporation of Gag into extracellular particles thereby indicating that the secretory pathway is not involved in targeting of Gag to the cell surface. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that newly synthesized Gag became rapidly and efficiently associated with membranes which had a density similar to that of plasma membrane- derived vesicles. Protease-protection studies confirmed that the Gag- containing membranes were of plasma membrane origin, since in crude cell homogenates, the bulk of newly synthesized Gag was protease- resistant as expected of a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Taken together these data indicate that targeting of M-MuLV Gag to the cell surface proceeds via direct insertion of the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, since the membrane insertion reaction is highly efficient and specific, this suggests that the reaction is dependent on as-yet-unidentified cellular factors.",

        "title": "First ever case report of co-occurrence of hobnail variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma and intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma in the same thyroid lobe.",
        "text": "INTRODUCTION The hobnail variant of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is rare. Intrathyroid parathyroid adenoma (ITPA) is also rare. Co-ocurrence of PTC and ITPA in the same thyroid lobe is extremely rare. Likewise, primary hyperparathyroidism with such non-medullary thyroid carcinoma is rare. The specific molecular profile of hobnail PTC (HPTC) is different from the classic, poorly differentiated and anaplastic variants and may contribute to its aggressive behavior. HPTC's genetic profile remains unclear. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 61-year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with generalized aches, bone pain, polyuria, and right neck swelling of a few months' duration. Laboratory findings revealed hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound of the neck showed 4.6 cm complex nodule within the right thyroid lobe. Sestamibi scan suggested parathyroid adenoma in the right thyroid lobe. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) revealed atypical follicular lesion of undetermined significance. She underwent right lobectomy, which normalized the intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone levels. Final pathology with immunohistochemical stains demonstrated HPTC and IPTA (2 cm each). Next-generation sequencing investigated the mutation spectrum of HPTC and detected BRAFV600E mutation. CONCLUSIONS A parathyroid adenoma should not exclude the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid evaluation is needed for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism to prevent missing concurrent thyroid cancers. Cytomorphologic features to distinguish thyroid from parathyroid cells on FNA cytology must be considered. Immunohistochemical stains are important. BRAFV600E is the most common mutation in HPTC. This is possibly the first reported case of HPTC and ITPA co-occurring within the same thyroid lobe. Studies that define other molecular abnormalities may be useful as therapeutic targets.",

        "text": "In recent years, mechanics has experienced a revival, as microfabrication technologies and nanotechnology are applied to produce tiny structures. The development of ultraprecise position sensing started three decades ago with a novel imaging technique called atomic force microscopy, which provides ultrahigh topography resolution on the atomic scale by raster-scanning the surface with a microfabricated cantilever beam that has a tiny tip at its free end. The high force sensitivity can not only be used for imaging, but also allows the measurement of surface forces during molecule adsorption processes on the cantilever surface, thus enabling cantilevers to act as chemical sensors. Because of their small size, cantilevers allow fast and reliable detection of small concentrations of molecules in air and solution. In addition to artificial nose and label-free biosensing applications, they have also been employed to measure physical properties of tiny amounts of materials in miniaturized versions of conventional standard techniques such as calorimetry, thermogravimetry, weighing, photothermal spectroscopy and monitoring of chemical reactions. In the past few years, the cantilever-sensor concept has been extended to medical applications and has entered clinics for pilot studies on patients. The small size and scalability of cantilever array sensors might turn out to be advantageous for diagnostic screening applications and disease monitoring, as well as for genomics or proteomics. Using microcantilever arrays allows simultaneous detection of several analytes and solves the inherent problem of thermal drifts often present when using single microcantilever sensors, as some of the cantilevers can be used as sensor cantilevers for detection, and others as passivated reference cantilevers that do not show affinity to the molecules to be detected.",

Publications were included if they studied SDM during the clinical encounter for minority adults in clinical care in the United States. We conducted a narrative, descriptive synthesis of each study. RESULTS From over 5000 publications identified through the search strategy, 18 met eligibility criteria following an abstract and full text (n = 685) review in Covidence. Studies focused on SDM in developing treatment plans (n = 10), and were conducted in primary care (n = 6) or hospital/health system settings (n = 6). Patients' decision preferences ranged from physician-driven altogether or initially, to patient-driven style. A comprehensive list of SDM facilitators and barriers was developed. CONCLUSION Despite strong policy and research SDM support to increase patient communication and a growing published literature, results suggest lack of representation of minority populations in contemporary literature.

Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations. During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years. Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens. A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms. In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19.

However, few studies regarding the epidemiology of hospitalizations for RSV infection have been performed previously in China. Here, we aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection in eastern China. Active surveillance for hospitalized ALRI patients using a broad case definition based on symptoms was performed from 2009\u20132013 in 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. Clinical and epidemiologic data pertaining to hospitalized patients of all ages with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection by PCR assay were collected and analyzed in this study. From 2009 to 2013, 1046 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection were enrolled in this study, and 14.7% of patients had subtype A, 24.2% of patients had subtype B, 23.8% of patients with subtype not performed, and 37.3% of patients had RSV coinfections with other viruses. RSV and influenza coinfections (33.3%) were the most common coinfections noted in this study. Moreover, young children aged <5 years (89.1%, 932/1046), particularly young infants aged <1 year (43.3%, 453/1046), represented the highest proportion of patients with RSV infections. In contrast, older adults aged \u226560 years (1.1%, 12/1046) represented the lowest proportion of patients with RSV infections among enrolled patients. The peak RSV infection period occurred mainly during autumn and winter, and 57% and 66% of patients exhibited symptoms such as fever (body temperature \u226538\u00b0C) and cough separately. Additionally, only a small number of patients were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and most of patients were treated with antimicrobial drugs that were not appropriate for RSV infection. RSV is a leading viral pathogen and a common cause of viral infection in young children aged <5 years with ALRIs in eastern China.

        "text": "Abstract The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend countries to establish a national severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance system for preparedness and emergency response. However, setting up or maintaining a robust SARI surveillance system has been challenging. Similar to other countries, surveillance data on hospitalisations for SARI in the Netherlands are still limited, in contrast to the robust surveillance data in primary care. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview, evaluation, and challenges of already available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands, which might be used for near real-time surveillance of severe respiratory infections. Seven available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands were reviewed. The evaluation criteria, including data quality, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability and stability were based on United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines for public health surveillance. We added sustainability as additional evaluation criterion. The best evaluated surveillance system or dataset currently available for SARI surveillance is crude mortality monitoring, although it lacks specificity. In contrast to influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary care, there is currently no gold standard for SARI surveillance in the Netherlands. Based on our experience with sentinel SARI surveillance, a fully or semi-automated, passive surveillance system seems most suited for a sustainable SARI surveillance system. An important future challenge remains integrating SARI surveillance into existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health, as well as hospital quality of care management and individual patient care.",

As the nucleotide sequences of neuraminidase (NA) of stain GD-01-06 were sequenced, we predicted the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-fold structure and the indexes of the flexible regions of secondary structure of NA with methods of the Hydrophilicity plot by Kyte-Doolittle, the Surface probability plot by Emini and the Antigenic index by Jameson-Wolf, and then screened statistically the parameters to predict B-cell epitopes by the Hierarchical cluster and the Bivariate correlation and the quartiles with SPSS 13.0. The impact of variation of amino acids in NA on its epitopes was analyzed. The predictive results were evaluated by Wu\u2019s Antigenic Index and SWISS-MODEL. We found that the most possible epitopes on NA were located within or nearby its N-terminal Nos. 120\u2013137, 81\u201384, 408\u2013415, 273\u2013282, 429\u2013432, 356\u2013368, 46\u201355, 146\u2013155, 341\u2013350 and 198\u2013209, which were the dominant regions of NA epitopes. Peptide 120\u2013137 including the glycoprotein domain (NGT(126\u2013128)) was first chosen as the B-cell epitopes on NA. NA in H(5)N(1) strain isolated after 2003 lacked in No. 53 amino acid (I), resulting in an increase in the surface flexible region of NA in GD-01-06 and an enlargement to their epitope regions (VEP(46\u201348) \u2192 VEPISNTNFL(46\u201355)). Conclusively, prediction of the B-cell epitopes on the NA based on multiple parameters is useful for researches on the molecular immunology and drug screening and immuno-prophylaxis.

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study using the General Practice Research Database of the United Kingdom. All study subjects were identified as sharing a residence with a patient with a diagnosis of acne. Outcome of interest was a URTI. RESULTS We identified 98,094 contacts of acne patients. A contact of an acne patient who had a URTI was about 43% more likely to develop a URTI than a contact of an acne patient who did not have a URTI (OR = 1.43 CI = 1.33-1.52, p < 0.001). Exposure to an acne patient using antibiotics did not independently increase a contact's risk of URTI (OR = 0.94, CI = 0.89-1.00, p = 0.063).

PV persists in the CNS of infected paralysed mice for over a year after the acute phase of paralytic poliomyelitis. However, infectious PV particles cannot be recovered from homogenates of CNS from paralysed mice after the acute phase of disease, indicating that PV replication is restricted. To identify the molecular mechanism by which PV replication is limited, PV RNA synthesis was analysed by estimating the relative level of genomic (plus-strand) and complementary (minus-strand) PV RNA in the CNS of persistently infected mice. PV RNA replication decreased during the 6 months following onset of paralysis, due mainly to inhibition of plus-strand RNA synthesis. Thus, restriction of PV RNA synthesis may contribute to persistence by limiting virus replication in the mouse CNS. Interestingly, viral RNA replication was similarly inhibited in neuroblastoma IMR-32 cell cultures persistently infected with PV. This in vitro model thus shows that cellular factors play a role in the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis.",

While PCR remains the frontline test of choice in the acute diagnostic setting, serological tests are urgently needed to fulfil the other requirements. Unlike PCR tests which are highly specific for each virus, cross-reactivity could potentially be a major challenge for COVID-19 antibody tests considering there are six other coronaviruses known to infect humans. Among the human pathogens, SARS-CoV is genetically most related to SARS-CoV-2 sharing approximately 80% sequence identity and both belong to the species SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) in the genus Betacoronavirus of family Coronaviridae. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of four different serological tests to comprehensively assess the cross-reactivity between COVID-19 and SARS patient sera. Our results indicate that there is a significant cross-reactivity when N protein of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 is used. The S1 or RBD derived the spike (S) protein offers better specificity. Amongst the different platforms, capture ELISA performed best. Finally, we found that SARS survivors all have significant level of antibodies remaining in their blood 17 years after infection.

        "text": "Hosts and pathogens are locked in an evolutionary arms race. To infect mice, mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) has evolved to recognize mouse CEACAM1a (mCEACAM1a) as its receptor. To elude MHV infections, mice may have evolved a variant allele from the Ceacam1a gene, called Ceacam1b, producing mCEACAM1b, which is a much poorer MHV receptor than mCEACAM1a. Previous studies showed that sequence differences between mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b in a critical MHV-binding CC' loop partially account for the low receptor activity of mCEACAM1b, but detailed structural and molecular mechanisms for the differential MHV receptor activities of mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b remained elusive. Here we have determined the crystal structure of mCEACAM1b and identified the structural differences and additional residue differences between mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b that affect MHV binding and entry. These differences include conformational alterations of the CC' loop as well as residue variations in other MHV-binding regions, including \u03b2-strands C' and C'' and loop C'C''. Using pseudovirus entry and protein-protein binding assays, we show that substituting the structural and residue features from mCEACAM1b into mCEACAM1a reduced the viral receptor activity of mCEACAM1a, whereas substituting the reverse changes from mCEACAM1a into mCEACAM1b increased the viral receptor activity of mCEACAM1b. These results elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism for how mice may have kept pace in the evolutionary arms race with MHV by undergoing structural and residue changes in the MHV receptor, providing insight into this possible example of pathogen-driven evolution of a host receptor protein.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Pathogen detection using DNA microarrays has the potential to become a fast and comprehensive diagnostics tool. However, since pathogen detection chips currently utilize random primers rather than specific primers for the RT-PCR step, bias inherent in random PCR amplification becomes a serious problem that causes large inaccuracies in hybridization signals. RESULTS: In this paper, we study how the efficiency of random PCR amplification affects hybridization signals. We describe a model that predicts the amplification efficiency of a given random primer on a target viral genome. The prediction allows us to filter false-negative probes of the genome that lie in regions of poor random PCR amplification and improves the accuracy of pathogen detection. Subsequently, we propose LOMA, an algorithm to generate random primers that have good amplification efficiency. Wet-lab validation showed that the generated random primers improve the amplification efficiency significantly. CONCLUSION: The blind use of a random primer with attached universal tag (random-tagged primer) in a PCR reaction on a pathogen sample may not lead to a successful amplification. Thus, the design of random-tagged primers is an important consideration when performing PCR.",

        "text": "Abstract Infectious diarrhea is the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal calves. Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the main pathogens associated with calf diarrhea. Although diarrhea is a symptom of infection with various pathogens, investigations to detect the types of pathogens have never been performed in Japan. This study investigated the prevalence of four major diarrhea-causing pathogens in calves: C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli K99). Commercial immunochromatography testing of all four pathogens and molecular analysis of C. parvum with diarrhea in calves from southernmost Okinawa and northernmost Hokkaido, Japan, were conducted. The frequencies of C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli (K99) in Okinawa were 50%, 28%, 2.3%, and 4.7%, respectively. Watery fecal stools were significantly correlated with C. parvum (p <0.05). In oocyst calculations for C. parvum, no significant difference was observed between the single-infection cases and the mixed-infection cases with rotavirus. Interestingly, molecular analyses targeting small subunit ribosomal RNA as well as glycoprotein 60 (GP60) genes revealed that the C. parvum nucleotide sequences from the two prefectures were identical, indicating that C. parvum with a uniform characteristic is distributed throughout Japan. GP60 subtyping analysis identified C. parvum from Okinawa and Hokkaido as belonging to the IIaA15G2R1 subtype, a known zoonotic subtype. Hence, control of cryptosporidiosis is important not only for pre-weaned calves, but also for human health.",

        "text": "Abstract Background Cepharanthine (CEP) is a drug used in Japan since the 1950s to treat a number of acute and chronic diseases, including treatment of leukopenia, snake bites, xerostomia and alopecia. It is the only approved drug for Human use in the large class of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This natural product, mainly isolated from the plant Stephania cephalantha Hayata, exhibits multiple pharmacological properties including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, immuno-regulatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-parasitic properties. Purpose The mechanism of action of CEP is multifactorial. The drug exerts membrane effects (modulation of efflux pumps, membrane rigidification) as well as different intracellular and nuclear effects. CEP interferes with several metabolic axes, primarily with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NF\u03baB signaling pathways. In particular, the anti-inflammatory effects of CEP rely on AMPK activation and NF\u03baB inhibition. Conclusion In this review, the historical discovery and development of CEP are retraced, and the key mediators involved in its mode of action are presented. The past, present, and future of CEP are recapitulated. This review also suggests new opportunities to extend the clinical applications of this well-tolerated old Japanese drug.",

Similarly, all practical trainings at clinics and on ambulances had to be put on hold. As the apprentices' training objective was acutely endangered by the expected lengthy teaching downtimes, it was of crucial importance to successfully establish homeschooling. While members of our teaching staff were additionally bound by support for the Munich crisis unit, the switch to virtual classroom teaching for all ongoing courses significantly increased the overall workload of the staff. In a first step, we established a fast video and communication platform via Microsoft Skype. All other issues had to be solved on the fly due to the lack of preparation time. Soon it became obvious that using only classic upfront teaching methods was not an option due to the resulting monotony of a full-time 35\u00e2\u0080\u00afh training week. Additionally, we had to ensure that exams would also be possible during homeschooling to avoid the accumulation of missing performance assessments. Within a few days, it became clear that almost all forms of social interactions and teaching methods could be integrated into the virtual classroom with minor limitations. A survey among students showed that while homeschooling cannot fully replace classroom teaching, it is considered a good alternative in emergency situations. Furthermore, many trainees think that homeschooling could be a valuable addition to normal classroom teaching.

        "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and represent a significant burden on the health care system. Laboratory testing is required to definitively distinguish infecting influenza virus from other pathogens, resulting in prolonged emergency department (ED) visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. Recently available rapid point\u2010of\u2010care tests (POCT) may allow for appropriate use of antiviral and antibiotic treatments and decrease patient lengths of stay. We undertook a systematic review to assess the effect of POCT for influenza on three outcomes: (1) antiviral prescription, (2) antibiotic prescription, and (3) patient length of stay in the ED. The databases Medline and Embase were searched using MeSH terms and keywords for influenza, POCT, antivirals, antibiotics, and length of stay. Amongst 245 studies screened, 30 were included. The majority of papers reporting on antiviral prescription found that a positive POCT result significantly increased use of antivirals for influenza compared with negative POCT results and standard supportive care. A positive POCT result also led to decreased antibiotic use. The results of studies assessing the effect of POCT on ED length of stay were not definitive. The studies assessed in this systematic review support the use of POCT for diagnosis of influenza in patients suffering an acute respiratory infection. Diagnosis using POCT may lead to more appropriate prescription of treatments for infectious agents. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of POCT on the length of stay in ED.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the main clinical features of COVID\u201019 infection are pulmonary, several associated neurological signs, symptoms and diseases are emerging. Incidence and characteristics of neurological complications are unclear. For this reason, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) core COVID\u201019 Task Force initiated a survey on neurological symptoms observed in patients with COVID\u201019 infection. METHODS: A 17\u2010question on\u2010line survey was made available on the EAN website and distributed to EAN members and other worldwide physicians starting on April 9(th), 2020. RESULTS: By April 27(th,) 2020, proper data were collected from 2,343 responders (out of 4,199), of whom 82.0% were neurologists, mostly from Europe. Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID\u201019 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID\u201019 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID\u201019 (neuro COVID\u201019). The most frequently reported neurological findings were headache (61.9%), myalgia (50.4%), anosmia (49.2%), ageusia (39.8%), impaired consciousness (29.3%), and psychomotor agitation (26.7%). Encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular disorders were reported at 21.0%. Neurological manifestations were generally interpreted as being possibly related to COVID\u201019, they were most commonly recognized in patients with multiple general symptoms, and occurred at any time during infection. CONCLUSION: Neurologists are currently and actively involved in the management of neurological issues related to the COVID\u201019 pandemic. This survey justifies setting up a prospective registry to better capture the prevalence of patients with neuro COVID\u201019, neurological disease characteristics and the contribution of neurological manifestations to outcome.",

        "text": "There is an increasing interest in using oral fluid to determine herd health and documenting the circulation of viruses in commercial swine populations but little is known about the stability of viruses in oral fluid. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic virus which is widespread in swine herds. Information on optimal handling methods such as heat treatments, freezing and RNA stabilization agents is needed to prevent or minimize degradation of viral RNA by degradative enzymes. The objectives of the study were to determine optimum handling conditions of the oral fluid before RNA extraction and to compare the performance of the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit, which contains a stabilizing agent, with that of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, which does not contain a stabilizing agent. Preliminary studies with oral fluid inoculated with HEV indicated that a heat treatment of 60 \u00b0C for 15 min was detrimental to HEV RNA. HEV was recovered from 25/25 and 24/25 samples of oral fluid when samples were incubated for \u226424 h at 4 \u00b0C and 30 days at \u221220 \u00b0C, respectively, without a stabilizing agent and extracted with the QiaAMP kit. In contrast, HEV RNA was detected in 16/25 and 11/25 samples when samples were incubated with a stabilizing agent for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 30 days at \u221220 \u00b0C, respectively, and extracted with the RNeasy Protect Saliva kit. Moreover, the mean number of genome copies/ml of HEV recovered from oral fluid stored at \u221220 \u00b0C without the stabilizing agent was 2.9 log units higher than oral fluid stored at \u221220 \u00b0C in the presence of the stabilizing agent. The recovery of RNA from HEV, F-RNA coliphage MS2 and murine norovirus (MNV), which are surrogates for norovirus, was significantly greater when oral fluid was incubated for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C than when oral fluid was stabilized with RNAprotect Saliva Reagent for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, where the relative differences between the two processes were 1.4, 1.8, and 2.7 log genome copies/ml for MS2, MNV, and HEV, respectively. The findings suggest that it is unnecessary to stabilize oral fluid from swine for the detection of viral RNA, provided the samples are stored at 4 \u00b0C or frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C, and that the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit did not perform well for the detection of viral RNA.",

        "text": "Abstract Reverse transcription requires two replicative template switches, called minus and plus strand strong stop transfer, and can include additional, recombinogenic switches. Donor and acceptor template homology facilitates both replicative and recombinogenic transfers, but homology-independent determinants may also contribute. Here, improved murine leukemia virus-based assays were established and the effects of varying extents of mismatches and complementarity between primer and acceptor template regions were assessed. Template switch accuracy was addressed by examining provirus structures, and efficiency was measured using a competitive titer assay. The results demonstrated that limited mismatch extension occurred readily during both minus and plus strand transfer. A strong bias for correct targeting to the U3/R junction and against use of alternate regions of homology was observed during minus strand transfer. Transfer to the U3/R junction was as accurate with five bases of complementarity as it was with an intact R, and as few as 3nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. In contrast, 12 base recombinogenic acceptors were utilized poorly and no accurate switch was observed when recombination acceptors retained only five bases of complementarity. These findings confirm that murine leukemia virus replicative and recombinogenic template switches differ in homology requirements, and support the notion that factors other than primer\u2013template complementarity may contribute to strong stop acceptor template recognition.",

        "text": "Background Lower respiratory tract infections in the first years of life are associated with later asthma, and this observation has led to a focus on the potential causal role of specific respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus, in asthma development. However, many respiratory viruses and bacteria trigger similar respiratory symptoms and it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the underlying susceptibility to infection and the exaggerated reaction to such triggers rather than the particular triggering agent. Objective We sought to study the association between specific infections in early life and development of asthma later in childhood. Methods Three hundred thirteen children were followed prospectively in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma in Childhood2000 high-risk birth cohort. Nine respiratory virus types (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses AH1, AH3, and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus) and 3 pathogenic airway bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were identified in airway secretions sampled during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life. Asthma was determined by age 7 years. Results In unadjusted analyses, all viruses and pathogenic bacteria identified during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms were associated with increased risk of asthma by age 7 years with similar odds ratios for all viruses and pathogenic bacteria. After adjustment for the frequency of respiratory episodes, the particular triggers were no longer associated with asthma. Conclusion The number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, was associated with later asthma development. This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and exaggerated response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than on the specific triggering agent.",

Also, samples were collected from quail (N = 4), Bluebird (Sialis, N = 1), and Greenfinch (Chloris chloris, N = 1) for analysis. Respiratory viral pathogens were screened by PCR and positive samples were subjected to virus isolation and genetic identification. Antigenic relatedness of isolated avian influenza (AI) H5 subtype was evaluated using cross-hemagglutination inhibition. Results revealed that the incidence of single virus infections in commercial broilers was 64.1% (25/39), with the highest incidence for ND (33.3%) and H9N2 (20.5%), followed by H5N1 (7.7%) and H5N8 (2.7). Meanwhile, H9N2/ND mixed infection was the most observed case (7.7%). Other mixed infections H5N1/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND/IB, H9N2/IB, and H9N2/ILT were also observed (2.6% each). In commercial layers, H5N1 and ILT were the only detected single infections (18.1% each). Mixed H9N2/ND was the most predominant infection in layers (27.3%). Other mixed infections of H9N2/IB, H5N1/H5N8/H9N2, and H9N2/ND/IB were observed in 3 separate farms (9.1% each). The H5N8 virus was detected in one quail farm and 2 out of 3 wild bird's samples. Partial HA gene sequence analysis showed the clustering of the selected AI H5N8 within the 2.3.4.4 clade, while H5N1 clustered with the clade 2.2.1.2. Interestingly, the H5N8 isolated from chickens possessed 6 amino acids substitutions at HA1 compared to those isolated from wild birds with low antigenic relatedness to AI H5N1 clades 2.2.1 or 2.2.1.2. In conclusion, mixed viral infections were observed in both broiler and layer chickens in Egypt. The detected triple H5N1, H9N2, and H5N8 influenza co-infection raises the concern of potential AI epidemic strain emergence. The low genetic and antigenic relatedness between AI H5N1 and H5N8 viruses suggest the need for modification of vaccination strategies of avian influenza in Egypt along with strict biosecurity measures.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is lacking. METHODS: We utilized Medicaid Extract files from 27 states from 1999 to 2006 linked to the National Cystic Fibrosis Registry to establish a cohort of children 0\u20132 years with CF diagnosis. Eligible children entered the cohort after CF diagnosis and after RSV season onset, and were followed until season end, second birthday, death, or hospitalizations for reasons other then the study outcome. Two outcomes were examined: hospitalization for RSV infections (RSV\u2010ha), or hospitalization for acute respiratory infections (ARI\u2010ha). Palivizumab exposure was defined based on pharmacy or procedure claims as current (claim date plus 30 days), former (day 31\u201360 after a claim), and no exposure (days before the first or >60 days after any claim). Both outcomes were examined in a Cox regression model, adjusting for RSV risk factors and CF severity via exposure propensity score. RESULTS: The matched cohort included 1,974 infants (2,875 infant seasons), who experienced 32 RSV\u2010ha and 212 ARI\u2010ha (3.9 and 26.2/1,000 season months, respectively). Compared to periods of no use, the adjusted hazard ratio for current use was 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20\u20131.60) for RSV\u2010related hospitalization and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59\u20131.21) for ARI\u2010related hospitalization. Each month of increasing age reduced the ARI\u2010ha by 5.8%. CONCLUSION: RSV hospitalization incidence was low suggesting either little contribution of the virus to respiratory infections in patients with CF or lack of RSV testing. Unadjusted and adjusted RSV\u2010hospitalization incidence rates suggested potentially positive effects of palivizumab, but results were inconclusive due to small event rates. Hospitalizations for acute respiratory illness with possible RSV contribution showed no association with palivizumab use, suggesting limited overall effect of palivizumab.

Failure to identify adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can lead to prescribing cascades and the unnecessary use of over-the-counter products. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore and quantify the frequency and severity of ADRs associated with amitriptyline vs. placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with any indication, as well as healthy individuals. METHODS A systematic search in six electronic databases, forward/backward searches, manual searches, and searches for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval studies, will be performed. Placebo-controlled RCTs evaluating amitriptyline in any dosage, regardless of indication and without restrictions on the time and language of publication, will be included, as will healthy individuals. Studies of topical amitriptyline, combination therapies, or including < 100 participants, will be excluded. Two investigators will screen the studies independently, assess methodological quality, and extract data on design, population, intervention, and outcomes ((non-)anticholinergic ADRs, e.g., symptoms, test results, and adverse drug events (ADEs) such as falls). The primary outcome will be the frequency of anticholinergic ADRs as a binary outcome (absolute number of patients with/without anticholinergic ADRs) in amitriptyline vs. placebo groups. Anticholinergic ADRs will be defined by an experienced clinical pharmacologist, based on literature and data from Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference. Secondary outcomes will be frequency and severity of (non-)anticholinergic ADRs and ADEs. The information will be synthesized in meta-analyses and narratives. We intend to assess heterogeneity using meta-regression (for indication, outcome, and time points) and I2 statistics. Binary outcomes will be expressed as odds ratios, and continuous outcomes as standardized mean differences. Effect measures will be provided using 95% confidence intervals. We plan sensitivity analyses to assess methodological quality, outcome reporting etc., and subgroup analyses on age, dosage, and duration of treatment. DISCUSSION We will quantify the frequency of anticholinergic and other ADRs/ADEs in adults taking amitriptyline for any indication by comparing rates for amitriptyline vs. placebo, hence, preventing bias from disease symptoms and nocebo effects. As no standardized instrument exists to measure it, our overall estimate of anticholinergic ADRs may have limitations.

Cleaning is required after long-term use; however, very little has been published on the subject. An experimental investigation has been launched to determine backpulse, backblow and combined backpulse\u2013backblow on cleaning of a loaded nanofiber filter. Nylon 6 nanofiber filters were loaded with polydispersed NaCl particles, 60%<100nm and 90%<160nm, generated from an aerosol generator. Air jets in form of backpulse, backblow and their combined mode were used to clean a loaded filter. During cleaning, the filter cake was removed first for which the pressure drop across the loaded filter decreased rapidly, followed by loosely attached aerosols in the filter being removed with finite pressure drop reduction at a reasonable rate, ending in the final stage for which much lesser aerosols were being removed. Ultimately, the filter reached a residual pressure drop which was higher than that of the initial clean filter indicating residual aerosols were trapped both in the cake heel and filter. Backpulse has been found to be more effective in removing the cake from the filter surface, whereas backblow provides an added advantage of removing by convection of the detached aerosols away from the filter preventing recapture. The synergistic combination of backpulse\u2013backblow provides the best cleaning performance of a nanofibrous filter loaded with nano-aerosols.",

        "text": "Waddlia chondrophila, an obligate intracellular bacterium of the Chlamydiales order, is considered as an agent of bovine abortion and a likely cause of miscarriage in humans. Its role in respiratory diseases was questioned after the detection of its DNA in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from pneumonia or bronchiolitis. To better define the role of Waddlia in both miscarriage and pneumonia, a tool allowing large-scale serological investigations of Waddlia seropositivity is needed. Therefore, enriched outer membrane proteins of W. chondrophila were used as antigens to develop a specific ELISA. After thorough analytical optimization, the ELISA was validated by comparison with micro-immunofluorescence and it showed a sensitivity above 85% with 100% specificity. The ELISA was subsequently applied to human sera to specify the role of W. chondrophila in pneumonia. Overall, 3.6% of children showed antibody reactivity against W. chondrophila but no significant difference was observed between children with and without pneumonia. Proteomic analyses were then performed using mass spectrometry, highlighting members of the outer membrane protein family as the dominant proteins. The major Waddlia putative immunogenic proteins were identified by immunoblot using positive and negative human sera. The new ELISA represents an efficient tool with high throughput applications. Although no association with pneumonia and Waddlia seropositivity was observed, this ELISA could be used to specify the role of W. chondrophila in miscarriage and in other diseases.",

Following the application of these wastes to land the potential exists for environmental contamination. Plants, soil and ultimately water courses which may subsequently be used as catchments for public water supplies may all be affected. Research attention is now being focused on this possibility, especially in the case of protozoan pathogens which may be the most important as they are often resistant to current methods used in public water treatment. In this review we highlight some of the many factors that are likely to influence the degree of pollution by their effect on both the vertical and horizontal transport of microorganisms through soil. Soil pH, temperature, the presence of plants, microbial surface properties, type of waste, soil type and soil water content and flow may all affect the rate and extent of vertical transport, with the latter two generally considered to be the most important. Lateral movement is a particular problem in soils with impermeable substrata or in waterlogged conditions and in these cases the major factors affecting movement include rainfall rate, topography of the land and the rate at which microorganisms partition into the runoff.",

        "title": "Insights into molecular evolution recombination of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 using Saudi Arabian sequences",
        "text": "The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae; Betacoronavirus) is the underlying cause of COVID-19 disease. Here we assessed SARS-CoV2 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia alongside sequences of SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-CoV, the latter currently detected in this region. Phylogenetic analysis, natural selection investigation and genome recombination analysis were performed. Our analysis showed that all Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences are of the same origin and closer proximity to bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by SARS-CoVs, however quite distant to MERS-CoV. Moreover, genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoVs. This was further assessed by S gene recombination analysis. These recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus. Moreover, positive selection pressure was detected between SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV isolates and human SARS-CoV isolates. However, the highest positive selection occurred between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and 2 bat-SL-CoV isolates (Bat-SL-RsSHC014 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45). This further indicates that SARS-CoV-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat SARS-like isolates, and that a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic. This study thuds sheds further light on the origin of this virus. AUTHOR SUMMARY The emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported. Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis, SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen. Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this virus.",

We analyzed approximately 15 million COVID-19 related posts on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like social media platform in China, from November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. We developed a machine learning classifier to identify\"sick posts,\"which are reports of one's own and other people's symptoms and diagnosis related to COVID-19. We then modeled the predictive power of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts. We found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts, up to 14 days ahead of official statistics. But other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power. For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China, regardless of unequal distribution of healthcare resources and outbreak timeline. Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19.

        "text": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate patients' attitudes toward the postponement of their scheduled procedures for pelvic floor disorders (PFD) because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives were to identify patients who were upset with the postponement of their PFD procedures and to identify factors that are associated with being upset because of the delay in care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, survey-based study of women from a single urban, academic practice using a novel questionnaire. The study cohort included women whose PFD surgeries or office procedures were postponed between March 17 and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Ninety-eight women had surgeries postponed; 68 (70%) responded to our questionnaire. Nearly half of the respondents (32/68, 47.1%) were upset about their procedures being postponed. Upset patients reported a greater impact of PFD symptoms on their mood than those who were not upset (P = 0.002). Those who were upset were also more likely to report feelings of isolation (P = 0.006), fear that their PFD would worsen because of delayed care (P < 0.001), and anxiety over surgery postponement (P < 0.001) than those who were not upset about the delays. When controlling for anxiety, social isolation, and impact of PFD symptom, anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 15.7; 95% confidence interval = 3.7-66.6) and feeling of isolation (adjusted odds ratio = 9.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-63.7) remained associated with increased odds of being upset because of procedure delays.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the overall outcome for dogs with NSAID overdose treated with TPE and to determine if any presenting factors can predict or influence overall outcome. Secondary objectives included investigating TPE complications as well as the utility of other adjunctive treatments. ANIMALS Eleven client-owned dogs presented for NSAID overdose that received TPE. All patients also received additional supportive treatment including IV lipid infusion. METHODS Retrospective review of medical records. RESULTS Eleven cases were included in the study. Of these, the NSAID ingested was ibuprofen in 6 (54.5%), naproxen in 4 (36.4%), and deracoxib in 1 (9.1%). All dogs survived to discharge with 3 (27.3%) developing acute kidney injury during hospitalization. A larger initial dose of NSAID ingested was associated with a higher maximum serum creatinine concentration during hospitalization (P = .04) and larger change in serum creatinine concentration from baseline (P = .02). Six dogs (54.5%) developed complications associated with TPE. The use of other treatments did not affect the overall outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE We identified TPE as an effective treatment for NSAID overdose with good outcomes despite high doses of NSAID ingestion in dogs treated with a single TPE treatment.

        "text": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate anxiety among children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their mothers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 45 patients with CF and their mothers were enrolled in the study together with 90 age-matched healthy children and their mothers as a control group. The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered by teleconference with children aged 13 to 18 years old and their mothers. The STAI for children was administered with children aged 9 to 12 years. Results were compared with age-matched healthy children and their mothers. The relationship between anxiety scores of children with CF and their mothers was evaluated by comparing with clinical data of children with CF. At the conclusion of the teleconference, mothers were asked whether their anxiety had changed as a result of the interview. RESULTS: It was found that healthy children aged 13 to 18 years had higher state anxiety scores than age-matched children with CF. Mothers of children with CF had higher trait anxiety scores, especially those of children aged 0 to 12 years, than mothers of healthy children (P < .05). For mothers of children with CF, state anxiety scores were higher among those whose children had chronic Pseudomonas infection (P < .05). Most mothers of children with CF stated that their anxiety decreased following the interview. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may increase anxiety among mothers of children with CF as well those with healthy children. However, COVID-19 had no effect on the anxiety of children with CF.

        "text": "OBJECTIVE To characterize how early mobilization is defined in the published literature and describe the evidence on safety and efficacy on early mobilization in critically ill children. STUDY DESIGN Systematic search of randomized and nonrandomized studies assessing early mobilization-based physical therapy in critically ill children under 18 years of age in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, the National Institutes of Health, Evidence in Pediatric Intensive Care Collaborative, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and the Mobilization-Network. We extracted data to identify the types of mobility-based interventions and definitions for early, as well as barriers, feasibility, adverse events, and efficacy outcomes (mortality, morbidities, and length of stay). RESULTS Of 1199 titles found, we included 11 studies (2 pilot trials and 9 observational studies) and 1 clinical practice guideline in the analyses. Neurodevelopmentally appropriate increasing mobility levels have been described for critically ill children, and \"early\" mobilization was defined as either a range (within 48-72 hours) from admission to the pediatric intensive care unit or when clinical safety criteria are met. Current evidence suggests that early mobilization is safe and feasible and institutional practice guidelines significantly increase the frequency of rehabilitation consults, improve the proportion of patients who receive early mobilization, and reduce the time to mobilization. However, there were inconsistencies in populations and interventions across studies, and imprecision and risk of bias in included studies that precluded us from pooling data to evaluate the efficacy outcomes of early mobilization. CONCLUSIONS The definition of early mobilization varies, but seems to be feasible and safe in critically ill children. The efficacy for early mobilization in this population is yet undetermined because of the low certainty of the evidence available.",

        "text": "Spatiotemporal protein reorganization at DNA damage sites induced by genotoxic chemotherapies is crucial for DNA damage response (DDR), which influences treatment response by directing cancer cell fate. This process is orchestrated by valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA+ ATPase that extracts polyubiquinated chromatin proteins and facilitates their turnover. However, because of the essential and pleiotropic effects of VCP in global proteostasis, it remains challenging practically to understand and target its DDR-specific functions. We describe a DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation event (Ser784), which selectively enhances chromatin-associated protein degradation mediated by VCP and is required for DNA repair, signaling, and cell survival. These functional effects of Ser784 phosphorylation on DDR correlate with a decrease in VCP association with chromatin, cofactors NPL4/UFD1, and polyubiquitinated substrates. Clinically, high phospho-Ser784-VCP levels are significantly associated with poor outcome among chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients. Thus, Ser784 phosphorylation is a DDR-specific enhancer of VCP function and a potential predictive biomarker for chemotherapy treatments.",

        "text": "Stool contains DNA shed from cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and has great potential as a bio-specimen for non-invasive, nucleic acid-based detection of GI diseases. Whereas methods for studying faecal microbiome DNA are plentiful, there is a lack of well-characterised procedures for stabilisation, isolation, and quantitative analysis of faecal host DNA. We report an optimised pipeline for faecal host DNA analysis from the point-of-collection to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) absolute quantification of host-specific gene targets. We evaluated multiple methods for preservation and isolation of host DNA from stool to identify the highest performing methods. To quantify host DNA even if present in partially degraded form, we developed sensitive, human-specific short-amplicon ddPCR assays targeting repetitive nuclear genomic elements (LINE-1) and mitochondrial genes. We validated the ability of these optimised methods to perform absolute quantification of host DNA in 200 stool DNA extracts from samples that were serially collected from three healthy individuals and three hospitalised patients. These specimens allowed assessment of host DNA day-to-day variability in stool specimens with widely varying physical characteristics (i.e., Bristol scores). We further extended this approach to mouse stool analysis, to enable faecal host DNA studies in animal disease models as well.",

Before applying radiographic measurement to the treatment decision and before correlating the measurements to clinical outcome, an accuracy of measurements must be established. PURPOSE To summarize existing evidence on accuracy of the radiographic measurements of: (i) dorsal/volar tilt of the distal radius; (ii) radial shortening; (iii) ulnar variance; (iv) radial inclination; and (v) articular step-off of the distal radius. We conducted a systematic critical review of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database were searched. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Quality of included studies was assessed using a tailored version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS A total of 5908 publications were screened and five studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies assessed accuracy of articular step-off but with contradictory outcomes. Radiographic measurements of step-off were accurate in two studies and inaccurate in one study. In the last step-off study, some of their measurements varied significantly but accuracy was not reported. The radiographic measurements of ulnar variance were significantly underestimated when compared to the true variance. We were not able to include studies that assessed accuracy of radial shortening, radial inclination, or dorsal/volar tilt against a reference standard.

        "text": "OBJECTIVE To assess the direct costs of three surgical approaches in uterine cancer and the cost-effectiveness of incorporating robot-assisted surgery. METHODS A cost system that allocates the actual cost of resources used to treat each patient, as opposed to borrowing cost data from a billing system, was used to determine direct costs for patients who underwent surgery for uterine cancer from 2009 to 2010. These costs included all aspects of surgical care up to 6 months after discharge. Total amortized direct costs included the capital cost of three dual-console robotic platforms with 5 years of service contracts. Nonamortized costs were also calculated (excluded capital costs). Modeling was performed to estimate the mean cost of surgical care for patients presenting with endometrial cancer from 2007 to 2010. RESULTS Of 436 cases (132 laparoscopic, 262 robotic, 42 laparotomy), total mean amortized direct costs per case were $20,489 (laparoscopy), $23,646 (robot), and $24,642 (laparotomy) (P<.05 [robot compared with laparoscopy]; P=.6 [robot compared with laparotomy]). Total nonamortized costs per case were $20,289, $20,467, and $24,433, respectively (P=.9 [robot compared with laparoscopy]; P=.03 [robot compared with laparotomy]). The planned surgical approach in 2007 was laparoscopy, 68%; robot, 8%; and laparotomy, 24% compared with 26%, 64%, and 9%, respectively, in 2010 (P<.001). The modeled mean amortized direct costs per case were $21,738 in 2007 and $22,678 in 2010 (+$940). Nonamortized costs were $21,298 in 2007 and $20,573 in 2010 (-$725).

Twitter is one of the widely-used online platforms by Iranians inside and abroad for sharing their opinion, thoughts, and feelings about a wide range of issues. In this study, using more than 530,000 original tweets in Persian/Farsi on COVID-19, we analyzed the topics discussed among users, who are mainly Iranians, to gauge and track the response to the pandemic and how it evolved over time. We applied a combination of manual annotation of a random sample of tweets and topic modeling tools to classify the contents and frequency of each category of topics. We identified the top 25 topics among which living experience under home quarantine emerged as a major talking point. We additionally categorized broader content of tweets that shows satire, followed by news, is the dominant tweet type among the Iranian users.

        "text": "BACKGROUND: School preparedness for bioevents, such as emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and pandemics, is imperative, but historically has been low. METHODS: The Missouri Association of School Nurses members were sent an online survey during the 2013-2014 school year to assess current bioevent readiness. There were 15 and 35 indicators of school disaster and bioevent preparedness, respectively. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to delineate factors associated with higher school disaster and bioevent preparedness scores. RESULTS: In total, 133 school nurses participated, with a 33.6% response rate. On average, schools had fewer than half of the disaster or bioevent indicators. Disaster and bioevent preparedness scores ranged from 1-12.5 (mean, 6.0) and 5-25 (mean, 13.8), respectively. The least frequently reported plan components included bioterrorism-specific psychological needs addressed (1.5%, n = 2), having a foodservice biosecurity plan (8.3%, n = 11), and having a liberal sick leave policy for bioevents (22.6%, n = 30). Determinants of better bioevent preparedness include perception that the school is well prepared for a pandemic (P = .001) or natural disaster (P < .05), nurse being on the disaster planning committee (P = .001), and school being a closed point of dispensing (P < .05).

        "text": "Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients \u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.",

        "text": "ABSTRACT IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic associated with high mortality and effective treatment to prevent clinical deterioration to severe pneumonia has not yet been well clarified. OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan People's Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon \u03b1), antihypertensives, and chloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and 284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence.

Methods Respiratory samples (nasal/throat swabs) were collected between August 2010 and November 2012 and real time PCR was used to detect different viral pathogens. Results Viruses were detected in 32.1% (43/134) of samples from 101 patients. Specifically, 9% (12/134) were positive for HBoV, 8.2% (11/134) were positive for HAdV, 5.2% (7/134) were positive for HRV, and 1.5% (2/134) were positive for FLUBV or HMPV, as single infections. HRSV-A, HPIV-3, and HCoV-HKU1 were detected in one (0.75%) sample each. Co-infections were detected in 4.8% (6/134) of the samples. Peaks of viral infections were observed in March, April, May, August, and October. However, positive samples were detected all year round. Only 23.3% (10/43) of the positive samples were collected from patients with febrile illness. Conclusion Results presented in this report suggest that respiratory viral infections are largely under diagnosed in immunocompetent adults. Although the majority of young adult infections are not life-threatening they may impose a significant burden, especially in developing countries since these individuals represent a large fraction of the working force.",

        "text": "Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the effects of aging on hydromorphone-induced thermal antinociception in cats. Methods In a prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled design, 10 healthy female cats received each of the following treatments intramuscularly: hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg) and 0.9% saline (0.05 mL/kg) with a 1-week washout between treatments at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Skin temperature and thermal thresholds (TTs) were recorded before and up to 12 hours after injection. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures linear mixed model (\u03b1 = 0.05). Results After saline treatment, TT was not significantly different from baseline at any time point for any age group. After hydromorphone treatment, TT was significantly higher than baseline at 6 months for up to 1 hour, and at 9 and 12 months for up to 4 hours. Peak TT at 6, 9, and 12 months were 50.4 \u00b1 2.7, 50.9 \u00b1 2.0, and 53.6 \u00b1 2.0\u00b0C at 0.5, 1, and 1 hours, respectively. Mean TT was significantly higher after hydromorphone treatment when compared with saline treatment at 9 and 12 months for up to 4 hours but not at 6 months. Magnitude of antinociception was consistently larger at 12 months when compared with 6 months of age. Hydromorphone provided a shorter duration and smaller magnitude of antinociception at 6 months when compared with 9 and 12 months.

We argue that these have arisen from at least five separate evolutionary origins, each of which is represented by a set of one or more modern-day families, termed a clan. Clan CA is the largest, containing the papain family, C1, and others with the Cys/His catalytic dyad. Clan CB (His/Cys dyad) contains enzymes from RNA viruses that are distantly related to chymotrypsin. The peptidases of clan CC are also from RNA viruses, but have papain-like Cys/His catalytic sites. Clans CD and CE contain only one family each, those of interleukin-1\u03b2-converting enzyme and adenovirus L3 proteinase, respectively. A few families cannot yet be assigned to clans. In view of the number of separate origins of enzymes of this type, one should be cautious in generalising about the catalytic mechanisms and other properties of cysteine peptidases as a whole.

Clinical signs, gross lesions, histopathological changes, ciliary activity, viral RNA detection, and serology were evaluated during 42 days post infection. All AvCoV isolates induced clinical signs, gross lesions in the trachea, moderate histopathological changes in the respiratory tract, and mild changes in other tissues.

        "text": "Recognition of RNA templates by viral replicase proteins is one of the key steps in the replication process of all RNA viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, including primary RNA elements that are recognized by the viral replicase proteins, are not well understood. Here, we used aptamer pulldown assays with membrane fractionation and protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation in a cell-free viral translation/replication system to investigate how viral replicase proteins recognize the bipartite genomic RNAs of the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). RCNMV replicase proteins bound specifically to a Y-shaped RNA element (YRE) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA2, which also interacted with the 480-kDa replicase complexes that contain viral and host proteins. The replicase-YRE interaction recruited RNA2 to the membrane fraction. Conversely, RNA1 fragments failed to interact with the replicase proteins supplied in trans. The results of protein-RNA coimmunoprecipitation assays suggest that RNA1 interacts with the replicase proteins coupled with their translation. Thus, the initial template recognition mechanisms employed by the replicase differ between RCNMV bipartite genomic RNAs and RNA elements are primary determinants of the differential replication mechanism.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND Despite significant developments in transurethral surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), simple prostatectomy remains an excellent option for patients with large glands. OBJECTIVE To describe our technique of transvesical robotic simple prostatectomy (RSP). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From May 2011 to April 2013, 25 patients underwent RSP. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed RSP using our technique. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographics, pathology data, perioperative complications, 90-d complications, and functional outcomes were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Mean patient age was 72.9 yr (range: 54-88), baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 23.9 (range: 9-35), prostate volume was 149.6 ml (range: 91-260), postvoid residual (PVR) was 208.1 ml (range: 72-800), maximum flow rate (Qmax) was 11.3 ml/s, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 9.4 ng/ml (range: 1.9-56.3). Eight patients were catheter dependent before surgery. Mean operative time was 214 min (range: 165-345), estimated blood loss was 143 ml (range: 50-350), and the hospital stay was 4 d (range: 2-8). There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions to open surgery. Five patients had a concomitant robotic procedure performed. Early functional outcomes demonstrated significant improvement from baseline with an 85% reduction in mean IPSS (p<0.0001), an 82.2% reduction in mean PVR (p=0.014), and a 77% increase in mean Qmax (p=0.20). This study is limited by small sample size and short follow-up period. One patient had a urinary tract infection; two had recurrent hematuria, one requiring transfusion; one patient had clot retention and extravasation, requiring reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Our technique of RSP is safe and effective. Good functional outcomes suggest it is a viable option for BPH and larger glands and can be used for patients requiring concomitant procedures.

        "text": "BACKGROUND High-resolution, multiphase, computed tomography (CT) is a standard preoperative test prior to pancreatectomy, yet the clinical significance of routinely reported findings remains unknown. METHODS We identified patients who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for a periampullary adenocarcinoma (PA) over the previous 5 years and had a pancreas protocol CT at our institution. Clinicopathologic implications of reported CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS There were 155 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) and 47 non-pancreatic PAs. No mass was visualized on CT in 6 % of PDAs and 23 % of non-pancreatic PA. A size discrepancy of \u22651 cm between radiographic and pathologic tumor diameters was observed in 40 % of PAs, with CT underestimating the size in most instances (75 %). Radiographically enlarged lymph nodes were not associated with true lymph node metastases in PDAs (70 % lymph node positive cases were enlarged on CT vs 74 % lymph node negative, p = 0.5), but were associated with a preoperatively placed biliary endoprosthesis (63 % with endoprosthesis were enlarged vs 37 % no endoprosthesis, p = 0.013). Major visceral vessel involvement on CT was not associated with a vascular resection (3 % with CT vessel involvement vs 2 % without, p = 0.8) or a positive uncinate resection margin (24 vs 20 %, respectively, p = 0.6). DISCUSSION While dedicated pancreas protocol CT provides unprecedented detail, the test may lead to overinterpretation of the extent of disease in some instances. A radiographic suggestion of enlarged lymph nodes and vascular involvement does not necessarily preclude exploration with curative intent. CTs with local disease should be reported in an objective template and carefully reviewed by a multidisciplinary group of surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists to avoid missing an opportunity for neoadjuvant therapy or cure by resection.",

The study aimed to report how the demand for urgent endoscopy changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and to evaluate the appropriateness of urgent referrals in the Endoscopy Unit.Material and methods: Nation-wide, cross-sectional survey study in 54 Italian GI Units. Data were collected regarding urgent endoscopies (EGD, CS, ERCP) in two different time periods: March 2019 and March 2020.Results: Thirty-five (64.8%) GI endoscopy Units responded to the survey. The entity of reduction of overall urgent EGDs and CSs performed in March 2020 versus March 2019 was statistically significant: 541 versus 974 (-80%), p < .001 for EGD and 171 versus 265 (-55%), p < .008, for CS, respectively. No statistically significant reduction of urgent ERCP performed in March 2020 versus March 2019 was found.

Like SARS-CoV, ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 is essential for virus to entry to the cell. ACE2 is a part of RAS which is expressed in several organs that opposes the AngII functions by converting Ang II to Ang (1-7), the one with vasodilation effects. The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated about 3.4%, however, some comorbid conditions like underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of mortality. In addition, cardiovascular involvement by SARS-CoV2 could be direct through either ACE2 receptors which are expressed tremendously in heart, or by the surge of different cytokines or by ARDS-induced hypoxia. Traditional risk factors could aggravate the process of COVID-19 infection that urges the triage of these high risk patients for SARS-CoV2. Currently, there is no effective, proven treatment or vaccination for COVID-19, but many investigators are struggling to find a treatment strategy as soon as possible. Some potential medications like chloroquine by itself or in combination with azithromycin, and some protease inhibitors used for the treatment of COVID-19 have cardiovascular adverse effects that should be kept in mind in order to close monitor of the patients receiving these medications.",

        "text": "Strategies to lessen the impact of pandemic influenza include behavioural modifications of the general public regarding medical care, personal hygiene and protection, and social distancing. We conducted a telephone survey of Beijing residents to evaluate potential behavioural changes in the general public in the event of an influenza pandemic occurring. We used a two-stage Mitofsky-Waksberg telephone survey of Beijing residents aged 15 years. The sample was weighted to reflect the 2000 census. We asked the respondents about their current healthcare-seeking behaviours for influenza-like illness (ILI), protective measures (personal hygiene, social distancing), and compliance with health authorities. We then asked what they would do during a hypothetical pandemic. We interviewed 256 Beijing participants in our study (response rate 56%). The percent of participants consulting a doctor for ILI rose from the current 41% [95% confidence interval (CI) 35-47] to 74% (95% CI 68-79) during a pandemic. Fifty-five percent (95% CI 48-62) of the participants would seek care from a more specialized hospital during a pandemic than currently. More than 90% of the participants reported already practising hand-washing or covering their coughs or sneezes during a non-pandemic period; this percentage changed little under a pandemic scenario. Compared to the current social distancing practices, more people would avoid crowded places (77% vs. 92%, P<0.01), use a mask outside the home (10% vs. 58%, P<0.01), and take time off from work or school (17% vs. 38%, P<0.01) during a pandemic. Moreover, 26% of the participants (95% CI 21-32) would stockpile food or water, and 55% (95% CI 49-61) would stockpile medicines. Some of the behavioural changes reported by Beijing participants might help to alleviate the damage caused by a potential pandemic. However, increased use of medical care at referral hospitals will further strain the healthcare system during a pandemic.",

Using questionnaires, we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an Indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area. We surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in West Java. Villages were classified into 3 groups: inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1\u20135 km or 5\u201310 km away from the reserve\u2019s outer border. Data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics (age, sex and occupation); histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans, dogs and other domestic animals; and knowledge about infectious diseases, mainly rabies, in flying foxes. We found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food, especially during the fruit season. In these residential areas, flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals, especially dogs. People who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment, such as leather gloves, goggles and caps. The residents living around the conservation area mostly had poor knowledge about flying foxes and disease transmission.

Firstly, they are unique in the diversity of host species that they infect. This includes waterfowl (the original reservoir), terrestrial and aquatic poultry, swine, humans, horses, dog, cats, whales, seals and several other mammalian species. Secondly, they are unique in their capacity to evolve and adapt, following crossing the species barrier, in order to replicate and spread to other individuals within the new species. Finally, they are unique in the frequency of inter-species transmission events that occur. Indeed, the consequences of novel influenza virus strain in an immunologically na\u00efve population can be devastating. The problems that influenza A viruses present for human and animal health are numerous. For example, influenza A viruses in humans represent a major economic and disease burden, whilst the poultry industry has suffered colossal damage due to repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.

        "text": "BACKGROUND: This article describes a bibliometric review of the scientific production, geographical distribution, collaboration, impact, and subject area focus of pneumonia research indexed on the Web of Science over a 15-year period. METHODS: We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) of \u201cPneumonia\u201d from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews, analyzing descriptive indicators by five-year periods and the scientific production by country, adjusting for population, economic, and research-related parameters. RESULTS: A total of 22,694 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time, from 981 publications in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 (R(2) = 0.956). The most productive country was the USA (38.49%), followed by the UK (7.18%) and Japan (5.46%). Research production from China increased by more than 1000%. By geographical area, North America (42.08%) and Europe (40.79%) were most dominant. Scientific production in low- and middle-income countries more than tripled, although their overall contribution to the field remained limited (< 15%). Overall, 18.8% of papers were the result of an international collaboration, although this proportion was much higher in sub-Saharan Africa (46.08%) and South Asia (23.43%). According to the specific MeSH terms used, articles focused mainly on \u201cPneumonia, Bacterial\u201d (19.99%), followed by \u201cPneumonia, Pneumococcal\u201d (7.02%) and \u201cPneumonia, Ventilator-Associated\u201d (6.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia research increased steadily over the 15-year study period, with Europe and North America leading scientific production. About a fifth of all papers reflected international collaborations, and these were most evident in papers from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

        "title": "What we know but do not understand about nidovirus helicases",
        "text": "Abstract Helicases are versatile NTP-dependent motor proteins of monophyletic origin that are found in all kingdoms of life. Their functions range from nucleic acid duplex unwinding to protein displacement and double-strand translocation. This explains their participation in virtually every metabolic process that involves nucleic acids, including DNA replication, recombination and repair, transcription, translation, as well as RNA processing. Helicases are encoded by all plant and animal viruses with a positive-sense RNA genome that is larger than 7kb, indicating a link to genome size evolution in this virus class. Viral helicases belong to three out of the six currently recognized superfamilies, SF1, SF2, and SF3. Despite being omnipresent, highly conserved and essential, only a few viral helicases, mostly from SF2, have been studied extensively. In general, their specific roles in the viral replication cycle remain poorly understood at present. The SF1 helicase protein of viruses classified in the order Nidovirales is encoded in replicase open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), which is translated to give rise to a large polyprotein following a ribosomal frameshift from the upstream ORF1a. Proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein yields a dozen or so mature proteins, one of which includes a helicase. Its hallmark is the presence of an N-terminal multi-nuclear zinc-binding domain, the nidoviral genetic marker and one of the most conserved domains across members of the order. This review summarizes biochemical, structural, and genetic data, including drug development studies, obtained using helicases originating from several mammalian nidoviruses, along with the results of the genomics characterization of a much larger number of (putative) helicases of vertebrate and invertebrate nidoviruses. In the context of our knowledge of related helicases of cellular and viral origin, it discusses the implications of these results for the protein's emerging critical function(s) in nidovirus evolution, genome replication and expression, virion biogenesis, and possibly also post-transcriptional processing of viral RNAs. Using our accumulated knowledge and highlighting gaps in our data, concepts and approaches, it concludes with a perspective on future research aimed at elucidating the role of helicases in the nidovirus replication cycle.",

        "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a dramatic impact on health care systems and a variable disease course. Emerging evidence demonstrates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is associated with central nervous system disease. We describe central nervous system manifestations in critical patients with COVID-19 at our tertiary center. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of all actively critical patients with COVID-19 admitted to our tertiary care academic center in New Orleans, Louisiana, on April 22, 2020, with new onset of neurologic disease. Patients were grouped into 1 of 3 categories according to imaging and clinical features; encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and vasculopathy. RESULTS: A total of 27 of 76 (35.5%) critical patients with COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. Twenty patients (74%) were designated with COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, 2 (7%) with COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and 5 (19%) with COVID-19-associated vasculopathy. Sixty-three percent of neurologic findings were demonstrated on computed tomography, 30% on magnetic resonance imaging, and 44% on electroencephalography. Findings most often included ischemic strokes, diffuse hypoattenuation, subcortical parenchymal hemorrhages, and focal hypodensities within deep structures. Magnetic resonance imaging findings included diffuse involvement of deep white matter, the corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. For patients with large-territory ischemic stroke, all but one displayed irregular proximal focal stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of active critical COVID-19 admissions at our revealed a high percentage of patients with new neurologic disease. Although variable, presentations followed 1 of 3 broad categories. A better understanding of the neurologic sequalae and radiographic findings will help clinicians mitigate the impact of this disease.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the correlation between microbiological yield and radiographic activity, on chest computed tomography (CT), in suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases, despite CT being widely used, clinically. METHODS: We used multicenter retrospective data, obtained from medical records, focusing on the diagnostic performance for definite PTB. We categorized patients into four groups, by radiographic activity: definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive. RESULTS: Of the 650 patients included, 316 had culture-confirmed PTB; 190 (29.2%), 323 (49.7%), 70 (10.8%), and 67 (10.3%) were classified into the definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive groups, respectively. The corresponding observed culture rates for CT radiographic activity were 61.6%, 60.7%, 4.3% and 0%, respectively. When not only culture rates but TB-PCR and histological results were taken into consideration as definite PTB, it showed 66.6%, 67.2%, 14.3%, and 0% of each CT radiographic activity, respectively. Regarding the diagnostic performance for definite PTB, radiographic activity displayed high sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 94.6\u201398.5) and negative predictive values (92.7%, 95% CI, 86.6\u201396.2), considered definitely and probably active PTB. Apart from PTB, other etiologies, according to radiographic activity, were predominantly respiratory infections such as bacterial pneumonia and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic activity showed good diagnostic performance, and can be used easily in clinical practice. However, clinicians should consider other possibilities, because radiologic images do not confirm microbiological PTB.",

        "text": "Importance: The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. Objective: To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results: Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70\u00e2\u0080\u00af000) and 0.07% (21 of 30\u00e2\u0080\u00af000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70\u00e2\u0080\u00af000; 21 of 35\u00e2\u0080\u00af000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.",

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing carfilzomib-based with non-carfilzomib-based regimens in MM to investigate the risk of kidney toxicity. Point estimates were pooled in the form of risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. We identified four RCTs with 2954 patients. The median duration of treatment ranged from 16.3 to 88 weeks in carfilzomib arms. The cumulative rate of kidney toxicities in the carfilzomib arms was 21.3% for all grades and 8.3% for grades 3-5 toxicities, with acute kidney injury being the predominantly reported event. Patients receiving a carfilzomib-based regimen had a significantly higher risk of total kidney toxicity compared with those in the control arms, with pooled RR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.43-2.23, p < 0.001) and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.59-3.30; p < 0.001), for all grades and grades 3-5 toxicities, respectively. Despite adjustment for the duration of exposure in treatment arms, pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) for kidney toxicity was significantly increased in the carfilzomib arm compared with control (pooled IRR of 1.28 for all grades and 1.66 for grades 3-5 toxicity). Subgroup analysis based on carfilzomib dose, infusion length, and treatment setting did not identify any significant subgroup effect.

        "text": "INTRODUCTION: Emerging data have described poor clinical outcomes from infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) among African American patients and those from underserved socioeconomic groups. We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this special population. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted in an underserved area with a predominance of African American patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The onset of AKI and relation to clinical outcomes were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with AKI. RESULTS: Nearly half (49.3%) of the patients with COVID-19 had AKI. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher FiO2 requirement and D-dimer levels on admission. More subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria was seen in these patients, and the majority had a pre-renal urine electrolyte profile. Patients with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) as opposed to those with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) had higher rates of in-hospital death (52 vs. 23%, p = 0.005), need for vasopressors (42 vs. 25%, p = 0.024), and need for intubation (55 vs. 25%, p = 0.006). A history of heart failure was significantly associated with AKI after adjusting for baseline eGFR (OR 3.382, 95% CI 1.121\u201313.231, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: We report a high burden of AKI among underserved COVID-19 patients with multiple comorbidities. Those who had HA-AKI had worse clinical outcomes compared to those who with CA-AKI. A history of heart failure is an independent predictor of AKI in patients with COVID-19.",

Treg cell development and function are dependent on the transcription factor Foxp3. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to identify Foxp3 regulators in mouse primary Treg cells. Foxp3 regulators were enriched in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF nucleosome-remodeling and SAGA chromatin-modifying complexes. Among the three SWI/SNF-related complexes, the Brd9-containing non-canonical (nc) BAF complex promoted Foxp3 expression, whereas the PBAF complex was repressive. Chemical-induced degradation of Brd9 led to reduced Foxp3 expression and reduced Treg cell function in vitro. Brd9 ablation compromised Treg cell function in inflammatory disease and tumor immunity in vivo. Furthermore, Brd9 promoted Foxp3 binding and expression of a subset of Foxp3 target genes. Our findings provide an unbiased analysis of the genetic networks regulating Foxp3 and reveal ncBAF as a target for therapeutic manipulation of Treg cell function.",

Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) has been reported to be the receptor for PEDV, although robust evidence is lacking. In the present study, we explored whether pAPN functions as a receptor for PEDV. Human HeLa cells expressing pAPN and pAPN-positive porcine CPK cells failed to support PEDV infection, but were susceptible to infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes pAPN as a functional receptor. In contrast to TGEV, PEDV did not bind soluble porcine aminopeptidases (pAPs) and infection was not inhibited by the soluble form of pAPs. However, overexpression of pAPN in porcine CPK cells (CPK-pAPN cells) slightly increased the production of PEDV, and the increased replication in CPK-pAPN cells was inhibited by bestatin, an inhibitor of the protease activity of aminopeptidase N. These results suggest that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV, but promotes the infection of PEDV through its protease activity.",

However, the methodology for PIIC preoperative risk assessment remains unestablished. We aimed to develop a preoperative risk model for postgastrectomy PIIC. METHODS We collected 183,936 patients' data on distal or total gastrectomy performed in 2013-2016 for gastric cancer from the Japanese National Clinical Database and divided into development (2013-2015; n = 140,558) and validation (2016; n = 43,378) cohort. The primary outcome was the incidence of PIIC. The risk model for PIIC was developed using 18 preoperative factors: age, sex, body mass index, activities of daily living, 12 comorbidity types, gastric cancer stage, and surgical procedure in the development cohort. Secondarily, we developed another model based on the new scoring system for clinical use using selected factors. RESULTS The overall incidence of PIIC was 4.7%, including 2.6%, 1.7%, and 1.3% in anastomotic leakage, pancreatic fistula, and intra-abdominal abscess, respectively. Among the 18 preoperative factors, male [odds ratio, (OR) 1.92], obesity (OR, 1.52-1.96), peripheral vascular disease (OR, 1.55), steroid use (OR, 1.83), and total gastrectomy (OR, 1.89) strongly correlated with PIIC incidence. The entire model using the 18 factors had good discrimination and calibration in the validation cohort. We selected eight relevant factors to create a simple scoring system, using which we categorized the patients into three risk groups, which showed good calibration.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Ulsan University Hospital (tertiary teaching hospital), South Korea. Patients A total of 359 women underwent SPA-LAVH for the following conditions: benign uterine tumor, preinvasive uterine lesion, and microinvasive cervical cancer. Interventions The participants included 124 women with vault drains and 235 women without drains. Measurements Surgical outcomes, perioperative complications and morbidity, postoperative febrile morbidity. Results There were no differences in background features between drain and no-drain groups. In surgical outcomes, mean uterine weight (364.2 \u00b1 184.9 g vs. 263.7 \u00b1 138.6 g; p < 0.001), operation time (87.4 \u00b1 21.5 min vs. 73.0 \u00b1 17.6 min; p < 0.001), blood loss (225.3 \u00b1 122.2 mL vs. 150.4 \u00b1 95.2 mL; p < 0.001), and hemoglobin decline (1.97 \u00b1 0.96 g/dL vs. 1.42 \u00b1 0.89 g/dL; p < 0.001) were significantly larger for the drain group compared with the no-drain group.

These essential immune responses are triggered by common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products expressed through the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll/IL-1 domain. Toll/IL-1 adapter protein cascades are induced by an activated Toll/IL-1 to induce transient transcription responses. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, use an MyD88 adapter to Toll/IL-1 to initiate a proinflammatory cascade. TLR3 uses the toll receptor 3/4 induction factor adapter to initiate a different cytosolic adapter cascade with double-stranded RNA agonists. This non-MyD88 pathway induces both NF-\u03baB and type 1 interferon responses. By using a TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist, rintatolimod, we demonstrate significant unexpected differences in toxic responses between rats and primates. The mechanism of this differential response is consistent with a relative down-regulation of the NF-\u03baB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and humans, but not observed systemically in rat.

In the present study, we first explored the protein profile in aMPV/C-infected Vero cells using iTRAQ quantitative proteomics. A total of 921 of 7034 proteins were identified as significantly altered by aMPV/C infection. Three selected proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Bioinformatics GO analysis revealed multiple signaling pathways involving cell cycle, endocytosis, and PI3K-Akt, mTOR, MAPK and p53 signaling pathways, which might participate in viral infection. In this analysis, we found that PLK2 expression was upregulated by aMPV/C infection and investigated whether it contributed to aMPV/C-mediated cellular dysfunction. Suppressing PLK2 attenuated aMPV/C-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p53-dependent apoptosis and reduced virus release. These results in a mammalian cell line suggest that high PLK2 expression correlates with aMPV/C-induced apoptosis and viral replication, providing new insight into the potential avian host cellular response to aMPV/C infection and antiviral targets.",

To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5-related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4-related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus.

From the non-spiked bird samples (Australian Muscovy duck and Pacific black ducks) we detected 21 viruses, and we also present a summary of a few viruses detected in human faecal samples. We then present a detailed analysis of selected virus sequences in the avian samples that were somewhat similar to known viruses, and had good quality (Q20 or higher) and quantity of next-generation sequencing reads, and was of interest from a virological point of view, for example, avian coronavirus and avian paramyxovirus 6. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses while others were more distantly related with 70% or less identity to currently known/sequenced viruses. Besides detecting viruses, the technique also allowed the characterisation of host mitochondrial DNA present and thus identifying host species, while ribosomal RNA sequences provided insight into the \u201cribosomal activity microbiome\u201d; of gut parasites; and of food eaten such as plants or insects, which we correlated to non-avian host associated viruses.",

        "text": "The human respiratory tract is heavily exposed to microorganisms. Viral respiratory tract pathogens, like RSV, influenza and rhinoviruses cause major morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract disease. Furthermore, as viruses have limited means of transmission, viruses that cause pathogenicity in other tissues may be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It is therefore important to chart the human virome in this compartment. We have studied nasopharyngeal aspirate samples submitted to the Karolinska University Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden from March 2004 to May 2005 for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. We have used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to characterize viruses, as this provides the most unbiased view of the samples. Virus enrichment followed by 454 sequencing resulted in totally 703,790 reads and 110,931 of these were found to be of viral origin by using an automated classification pipeline. The snapshot of the respiratory tract virome of these 210 patients revealed 39 species and many more strains of viruses. Most of the viral sequences were classified into one of three major families; Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae or Orthomyxoviridae. The study also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C, and identified a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin.",

COVID-19 results in higher pathogenicity and mortality in the elderly compared to children. Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive coronavirus immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses, is critical to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fc{gamma} receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fc{gamma} receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity. These results suggest that less-experienced humoral immunity associated with higher IgM, as observed in children, may have the potential to induce more potent antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. These key insights will inform COVID-19 vaccination strategies, improved serological diagnostics and therapeutics.",

METHODS Air samples were collected from 7 wards and 1 balcony of the Hospital, 3 times a day for 3 continuous days, using bioaerosol sampler type FA-2. Bioaerosol particles were then washed down from the samples by serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) culture medium. Nested-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the N protein gene of the SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from these washing solutions. The residual solutions were inoculated into prepared cell cultures to isolate live virus. The positive samples were then identified by indirect immunofluorescence assay and sequence analysis of the PCR products. RESULTS Positive rates of RT-PCR test on air samples were 29.03% in the wards and 20.0% in balcony respectively. Results from sequential analysis showed that the homology of amplified cDNA fragments to previously known SARS-CoV stains was 98%. A strain of live pathogen was isolated from one of the 36 samples. The isolate could cause typical cytopathic effects, similar to those SARS-CoV on Vero-E6 cells and the effects could be stably passed. Indirect immunofluorescence assay showed positive from serum of a SARS patient. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV existed in the air hospital, where SARS patients were admitted to, but the activity of SARS-CoV in air samples was rather low. SARS patients could still shed SARS-CoV even during the recovery phase. Potential possibility of aerosol transmission might exist within 1 meter square area around SARS patients.",

We review the current implementation of this new technology for infectious disease diagnostics and discuss the feasibility of transforming mNGS into a routine diagnostic test. Since 2008, numerous studies from over 20 countries have revealed the practicality of mNGS in the work-up of undiagnosed infectious diseases. mNGS performs well in identifying rare, novel, difficult-to-detect and coinfected pathogens directly from clinical samples and presents great potential in resistance prediction by sequencing the antibiotic resistance genes, providing new diagnostic evidence that can be used to guide treatment options and improve antibiotic stewardship. Many physicians recognized mNGS as a last resort method to address clinical infection problems. Although several hurdles, such as workflow validation, quality control, method standardisation, and data interpretation, remain before mNGS can be implemented routinely in clinical laboratories, they are temporary and can be overcome by rapidly evolving technologies. With more validated workflows, lower cost and turnaround time, and simplified interpretation criteria, mNGS will be widely accepted in clinical practice.

We found that, first, a large proportion of the difference in CFRs can be attributed to different age structures of the cases. Second, lags of 5-10 days between day of case report and death should be used, since these provide the most constant estimates. Third, for France, Italy, and Spain, intensive care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients were positively associated with fatality risks of hospitalized cases.

        "title": "The Correlation of Two Cerebral Saturation Monitors With Jugular Bulb Oxygen Saturation in Children Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass for Congenital Heart Surgery.",
        "text": "BACKGROUND Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive monitoring technique that measures regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). OBJECTIVES The primary aim was to compare the output of 2 NIRS-based cerebral oximetry devices, FORESIGHT (CAS Medical Systems Inc, Branford, Connecticut) and INVOS (Covidien, Boulder, Colorado), to venous oxygen saturations from the jugular venous bulb at cannulation and decannulation of the superior vena cava (SVC). Secondary objectives included evaluating correlations of cerebral saturation, as measured by the NIRS devices, with mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), measured by an invasive arterial line, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). METHODS Near-infrared spectroscopy, MAP, and ETCO2 data were collected at 13 defined events during each case when hemodynamic instability was expected. At SVC cannulation and decannulation, a 0.1 mL sample of blood was collected from the jugular bulb by the surgeon using a long angiocatheter. The oxygen saturation of these blood samples was measured using an AVOX device and compared with contemporaneous readings from the NIRS probes. Mixed-effects linear regression was used to correlate MAP or ETCO2 with cerebral oxygen saturation (by NIRS) at each time point. RESULTS Children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital heart surgery (n = 34) were enrolled in the study. At SVC cannulation, both INVOS ( r = .78) and FORESIGHT ( r = .59) were correlated with AVOX data at P < .001, although the correlation with INVOS was significantly stronger ( P = .003). At SVC decannulation, INVOS ( r = .68; P < .001) and FORESIGHT ( r = .60; P < .001) were similarly correlated with jugular venous rSO2. Correlations of rSO2 (by NIRS) with MAP and ETCO2 levels were stronger than correlations between rSO2 change and change in MAP or ETCO2. CONCLUSION INVOS correlated more strongly than FORESIGHT with the jugular bulb rSO2 at SVC cannulation but may have underestimated oxygen saturation at low rSO2 values. Data from both NIRS devices were correlated with MAP and ETCO2 over the case duration.",

The virus was initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate from a 3-year-old child from Australia diagnosed with pneumonia. A random library was generated from nucleic acids extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate and analyzed by high throughput DNA sequencing. Multiple DNA fragments were cloned that possessed limited homology to known polyomaviruses. We subsequently sequenced the entire virus genome of 5,229 bp, henceforth referred to as WU virus, and found it to have genomic features characteristic of the family Polyomaviridae. The genome was predicted to encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that the WU virus was divergent from all known polyomaviruses. Screening of 2,135 patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and St. Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virus\u2013specific PCR primers resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU virus. The presence of multiple instances of the virus in two continents suggests that this virus is geographically widespread in the human population and raises the possibility that the WU virus may be a human pathogen.",

        "text": "Background. The primary modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appear to be direct mucus membrane contact with infectious droplets and through exposure to formites. Knowledge of the survival characteristics of the virus is essential for formulating appropriate infection-control measures. Methods. Survival of SARS-CoV strain GVU6109 was studied in stool and respiratory specimens. Survival of the virus on different environmental surfaces, including a laboratory request form, an impervious disposable gown, and a cotton nondisposable gown, was investigated. The virucidal effects of sodium hypochlorite, house detergent, and a peroxygen compound (Virkon S; Antec International) on the virus were also studied. Results. SARS-CoV GVU6109 can survive for 4 days in diarrheal stool samples with an alkaline pH, and it can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for >7 days at room temperature. Even at a relatively high concentration (10(4) tissue culture infective doses/mL), the virus could not be recovered after drying of a paper request form, and its infectivity was shown to last longer on the disposable gown than on the cotton gown. All disinfectants tested were shown to be able to reduce the virus load by >3 log within 5 min. Conclusions. Fecal and respiratory samples can remain infectious for a long period of time at room temperature. The risk of infection via contact with droplet-contaminated paper is small. Absorbent material, such as cotton, is preferred to nonabsorptive material for personal protective clothing for routine patient care where risk of large spillage is unlikely.

End-to-end vascular anastomosis was performed using continuous, non-interlocking sutures. Complete tissue reperfusion was achieved in all animals within 30 s after the vascular re-anastomosis, without any evidence of arterial or venous thrombosis. The immunosuppressive protocol consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone tablets. Graft viability was assessed by transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. RESULTS Viable uterine tissue and vascular patency were observed on transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy. Histological analysis of the graft tissue (performed in one ewe) revealed normal tissue architecture with a very subtle inflammatory reaction but no edema or stasis.

Particularly, protein\u2013protein interactions between viral surface proteins and host proteins as well as secondary host protein\u2013protein interactions play a pivotal role in coordinating virus binding and uptake. These interactions are dynamic and frequently involve multiprotein complexes. In the past decade mass spectrometry based proteomics methods have reached sensitivities and high throughput compatibilities of genomics methods and now allow the reliable quantitation of proteins in complex samples from limited material. As proteomics provides essential information on the biologically active entity namely the protein, including its posttranslational modifications and its interactions with other proteins, it is an indispensable method in the virologist's toolbox. Here we review protein interactions during virus entry and compare classical biochemical methods to study entry with novel technically advanced quantitative proteomics techniques. We highlight the value of quantitative proteomics in mapping functional virus entry networks, discuss the benefits and limitations and illustrate how the methodology will help resolve unsettled questions in virus entry research in the future.",

        "title": "Elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells during early steroid-associated osteonecrosis development",
        "text": "BACKGROUND: Increased bone marrow lipid deposition in steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) implies that abnormalities in fat metabolism play an important role in ON development. The increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR\u03b32). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPAR\u03b32 expression in either ON(+ )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group. CONCLUSION: These findings support our hypothesis that there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated osteonecrosis development.",

COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic. However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment. However, currently, there are no approved MSC-based approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients but clinical trials ongoing.",

Establishment of local immunity in the intestine would thus prevent TGEV transmission. CpG DNA has been reported as a promising mucosal adjuvant in some animals. The effects of oral immunization of CpG DNA together with inactivated TGEV (ITGEV) were investigated in this study. Pigs (6 weeks old) were orally immunized with ITGEV plus CpG DNA. The TGEV-specific IgA level in the intestinal tract and the TGEV-specific IgG level in serum significantly increased following immunization with ITGEV plus CpG DNA (P \u22640.05). Moreover, populations of IgA-secreting cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), in the intestine increased significantly after immunization with ITGEV plus CpG DNA (P \u22640.05). Furthermore, the expression of IL-6, IL-12 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) in ligated intestine segments increased significantly after injection with ITGEV plus CpG DNA (P \u2264 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that oral immunization of ITGEV plus CpG DNA elicits a local immune response.

        "text": "The recent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks exemplify the continued threat of (re-)emerging viruses to human health, and our inability to rapidly develop effective therapeutic countermeasures. Many viruses, including MERS-CoV and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. They bind and remove ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses. A variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs), including the MERS-CoV papain-like protease, are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle. Together, this makes vDUBs highly attractive antiviral drug targets. However, structural similarity between the catalytic cores of vDUBs and human DUBs complicates the development of selective small molecule vDUB inhibitors. We have thus developed an alternative strategy to target the vDUB activity through a rational protein design approach. Here, we report the use of phage-displayed ubiquitin variant (UbV) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. UbVs bound the vDUBs with high affinity and specificity to inhibit deubiquitination, deISGylation and in the case of MERS-CoV also viral replicative polyprotein processing. Co-crystallization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between UbVs and MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs, accounting for the observed binding specificity and high affinity. Finally, expression of UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents. Our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein-based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing UbVs via mRNA or protein delivery technologies or through transgenic techniques.",

Data loggers were deployed on eight of 54 A. jubatus (two males and six females) captured near Subic Bay on the Philippine island of Luzon between 22 November and 2 December 2010. Bodyweight ranged from 730 g to 1002 g, translating to a weight burden of 3\u20134% of bodyweight. Six of the eight loggers yielded useful data over 2\u201310 days, showing variability in the nature and range of individual bat movements. The majority of foraging locations were in closed forest and most were remote from evident human activity. Forty-six discrete foraging locations and five previously unrecorded roost locations were identified. Our findings indicate that foraging is not a random event, with the majority of bats exhibiting repetitious foraging movements night-to-night, that apparently intact forest provides the primary foraging resource, and that known roost locations substantially underestimate the true number (and location) of roosts.

        "text": "The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a global public health emergency infected by SARC-CoV-2 has caused devastating loss around the world. Currently, a lot of diagnosis methods have been used to detect the infection. The nucleic acid (NA) testing is reported to be the clinical standard for COVID-19 infection. Evidence shows that a faster and more convenient method to detect in the early phase will control the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a method to detect SARC-Cov-2 infection within two hours combined with Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) reaction and nanopore Flongle workflow. In this approach, RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification reaction with one step in 30 minutes at 60-65\u00b0C constant temperature environment, nanopore Flongle rapidly adapter ligated within 10 minutes. Flongle flow cell sequencing and analysis in real-time. This method described here has the advantages of rapid amplification, convenient operation and real-time detection which is the most important for rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Moreover, this approach not only can be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection but also can be extended to other respiratory viruses and pathogens.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacological mechanism of Guanxin II formula (II) for treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS: First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OB\u00e2\u00a9\u00be30%, DL\u00e2\u00a9\u00be0.18, and HL \u00e2\u00a9\u00be4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD. CONCLUSION: This network pharmacology-based exploration revealed that GX II might prevent and inhibit the primary pathological processes of CHD.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The efficiency of prehospital care chain response and the adequacy of hospital resources are challenged amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, with suspected consequences for patients with ischemic stroke eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). METHODS: We conducted a prospective national-level data collection of patients treated with MT, ranging 45 days across epidemic containment measures instatement, and of patients treated during the same calendar period in 2019. The primary end point was the variation of patients receiving MT during the epidemic period. Secondary end points included care delays between onset, imaging, and groin puncture. To analyze the primary end point, we used a Poisson regression model. We then analyzed the correlation between the number of MTs and the number of COVID-19 cases hospitalizations, using the Pearson correlation coefficient (compared with the null value). RESULTS: A total of 1513 patients were included at 32 centers, in all French administrative regions. There was a 21% significant decrease (0.79; [95%CI, 0.76-0.82]; P<0.001) in MT case volumes during the epidemic period, and a significant increase in delays between imaging and groin puncture, overall (mean 144.9\u00b1SD 86.8 minutes versus 126.2\u00b170.9; P<0.001 in 2019) and in transferred patients (mean 182.6\u00b1SD 82.0 minutes versus 153.25\u00b167; P<0.001). After the instatement of strict epidemic mitigation measures, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of hospitalizations for COVID and the number of MT cases (R2 -0.51; P=0.04). Patients treated during the COVID outbreak were less likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis and to have unwitnessed strokes (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a significant decrease in patients treated with MTs during the first stages of the COVID epidemic in France and alarming indicators of lengthened care delays. These findings prompt immediate consideration of local and regional stroke networks preparedness in the varying contexts of COVID-19 pandemic evolution.",

        "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses causing mainly respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans. Until recently five types of human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV) have been known, however a novel CoV has been identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. This virus, namely MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), was classified within Coronaviridae family, Coronavirinae sub-family, Betacoronavirus genus, clade C. It causes acute respiratory infections in humans and transmits via respiratory route and close contact between humans. The aim of this study was to present the first MERS case from Turkey identified by molecular methods and the results of viral sequence analysis. A 42-year-old male Turkish citizen who worked as an employee in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, admitted to hospital with the complaints of fever and malaise on 25-26 September 2014. Since his symptoms went on and got worse, he returned to Turkey, and hospitalized in a hospital's intensive care unit in Hatay on 6th of October with the symptoms of fever, malaise, sweating, cough and respiratory distress. He transferred to a university hospital on 8th of October and died on 11th October. The tracheal aspirate sample obtained before he died was sent to Virology Unit of Reference Laboratories of the Turkish Public Health Institution. Detection of viral RNA was performed by using a commercial real-time PCR kit (hCoV-EMC Real-Time RT-PCR, Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg) targeting the MERS-CoV E protein (upE), ORF1a and ORF1b gene regions. The reference method Superscript III One Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen, USA) recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) was also applied for confirmation. Both of the methods yielded positive results for MERS-CoV RNA. For the amplification of nucleocapsid (N) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, hemi-nested PCR (Invitrogen, ABD) was conducted, followed by sequence analysis of 204 nucleotide part of N gene. Phylogenetic tree of N gene was obtained with the use of MEGA6 software. N gene was chosen as it comprised a two aminoacid deletion in the corresponding published sequence from the patient treated in London, United Kingdom. There was no nucleotide or aminoacid change in our isolate, namely ANK/1079/2014 when compared with human Betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 reference strain found in Genbank database. The target gene regions selected in our study (UpE, ORF1a, ORF1b, N and RdRp) which were also recommended by WHO, shown to have high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis and confirmation of MERS-CoV, and also recommended by WHO. The previous studies indicated that, the viral genomes detected in the earliest cases of humans (clade A) are genetically distinct from the others (clade B) which were isolated from dromedary camels and humans. In our study, according to phylogenetic analysis of partial N gene segment, isolate ANK/1079/2014 has taken place within clade A. In conclusion, MERS-CoV appears to have limited circulation in Arabian Peninsula and Middle-Eastern countries, it should be considered in mind that travel-related cases may export the virus outside these regions leading autochtonous infections in the other parts of the world.",

        "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus\u20102 (SARS CoV\u20102). The SARS CoV\u20102 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than SARS CoV. Both, SARS CoV and SARS CoV\u20102 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme\u20102 (ACE\u20102) receptor. We generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of SARS CoV and SARS CoV\u20102 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in SARS CoV\u20102 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans. Our results show that among the genomes analysed, two sequence regions in the N\u2010terminal domain (NTD); \"MESEFR\" and \"SYLTPG\" are specific to human SARS CoV\u20102. In the receptor binding domain (RBD), two sequence regions; \"VGGNY\" and \"EIYQAGSTPCNGV\" and a disulfide bridge connecting 480C and 488C in the extended loop are structural determinants for the recognition of human ACE\u20102 receptor. The complete genome analysis of representative SARS CoVs from bat, civet, human host sources and human SARS CoV\u20102 identified the bat genome (GenBank code: MN996532.1) as closest to the recent novel human SARS CoV\u20102 genomes. The bat SARS CoV genomes (GenBank codes: MG772933 and MG772934) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression towards becoming human SARS CoV\u20102.

This re-emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in Brazil in 2016, where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs, efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle. In light of this, the relevance of the endosomal\u2013lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with either the African strain (associated with mild symptoms) or the French Polynesia strain (associated with neurological complications). For both strains, the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, efficiently inhibited ZIKV entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation. Additionally, affecting cholesterol metabolism and transport with the drug U18666A, which inactivates late endosomes and lysosomes, impairs the viral life cycle. The data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways. This highlights the relevance of the endosomal\u2013lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals.",

Lipid forms an integral part of many viruses and exists either in the form of a continuous envelope or in lipoprotein complexes that surround a nucleoprotein core or helix. In general, the envelope can be described as a molecular container for the genetic material of the virus. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and are not known to carry genetic coding for enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. Hence, they generally contain the same classes of lipid as are found in the host cell or their membrane of assembly. Lipids make up 20\u201335% by weight of most viruses; however, there are exceptions such as vaccinia virus, which has only 5% lipid despite having a complex multimembrane envelope structure. Naked herpesvirus capsids closely resemble non-lipid-containing viruses such as adenovirus or polyoma virus, which are also assembled in the nucleus but show full infectivity without any envelope.

        "text": "The defective interfering (DI) RNA MIDI of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) contains a large open reading frame (ORF) spanning almost its entire genome. This ORF consists of sequences derived from ORF1a, ORF1b, and the nucleocapsid gene. We have previously demonstrated that mutations that disrupt the ORF decrease the fitness of MIDI and its derivatives (R. J. de Groot, R. G. van der Most, and W. J. M. Spaan, J. Virol. 66:5898-5905, 1992). To determine whether translation of the ORF per se is required or whether the encoded polypeptide or a specific sequence is involved, we analyzed sets of related DI RNAs containing different ORFs. After partial deletion of ORF1b and nucleocapsid gene sequences, disruption of the remaining ORF is still lethal; translation of the entire ORF is not essential, however. When a large fragment of the MHV-A59 spike gene, which is not present in any of the MHV-A59 DI RNAs identified so far, was inserted in-frame into a MIDI derivative, translation across this sequence was vital to DI RNA survival. Thus, the translated sequence is irrelevant, indicating that translation per se plays a crucial role in DI virus propagation. Next, it was examined during which step of the viral life cycle translation plays its role. Since the requirement for translation also exists in DI RNA-transfected and MHV-infected cells, it follows that either the synthesis or degradation of DI RNAs is affected by translation.",

However, insufficient genomic annotation hampers detailed studies of ferret T cell responses. In this study, we analyzed the published T cell receptor beta (TRB) locus and performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of peripheral blood of four healthy adult ferrets to identify expressed V, D, J, and C genes. The HTS data is used as a guide to manually curate the expressed V, D, J, and C genes. The ferret locus appears to be most similar to that of the dog. Like other mammalian TRB loci, the ferret TRB locus contains a library of variable genes located upstream of two D-J-C gene clusters, followed by a (in the ferret non-functional) V gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation. All TRB genes (expressed or not) reported here have been approved by the IMGT/WHO-IUIS nomenclature committee.

Patients rated psychological wellbeing using the Schwartz Outcome Scale (SOS-10); clinicians rated the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). In an analysis of variance with covariates, race/ethnicity exhibited a small but statistically significant association with GAF (F(4,8481)=17.902, p<.001) and SOS-10 scores (F(4,8165)=7.271, p<.001). However, after adjustment for physical health and socioeconomic variables, these differences became insignificant or were reversed.

        "text": "Early during de novo infection of human microvascular dermal endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (human herpesvirus 8 [HHV-8]) induces the host cell's preexisting FAK, Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), Rho-GTPases, Diaphanous-2 (Dia-2), Ezrin, protein kinase C-zeta, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and NF-kappaB signal pathways that are critical for virus entry, nuclear delivery of viral DNA, and initiation of viral gene expression. Since several of these signal molecules are known to be associated with lipid raft (LR) domains, we investigated the role of LR during KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells. Pretreatment of cells with LR-disrupting agents methyl beta-cyclo dextrin (MbetaCD) or nystatin significantly inhibited the expression of viral latent (ORF73) and lytic (ORF50) genes. LR disruption did not affect KSHV binding but increased viral DNA internalization. In contrast, association of internalized viral capsids with microtubules (MTs) and the quantity of infected nucleus-associated viral DNA were significantly reduced. Disorganized and disrupted MTs and thick rounded plasma membranes were observed in MbetaCD-treated cells. LR disruption did not affect KSHV-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation; in contrast, it increased the phosphorylation of Src, significantly reduced the KSHV-induced PI3-K and RhoA-GTPase and NF-kappaB activation, and reduced the colocalizations of PI3-K and RhoA-GTPase with LRs. Biochemical characterization demonstrated the association of activated PI3-K with LR fractions which was inhibited by MbetaCD treatment. RhoA-GTPase activation was inhibited by PI3-K inhibitors, demonstrating that PI3-K is upstream to RhoA-GTPase. In addition, colocalization of Dia-2, a RhoA-GTPase activated molecule involved in MT activation, with LR was reduced. KSHV-RhoA-GTPase mediated acetylation and aggregation of MTs were also reduced. Taken together, these studies suggest that LRs of endothelial cells play critical roles in KSHV infection and gene expression, probably due to their roles in modulating KSHV-induced PI3-K, RhoA-GTPase, and Dia-2 molecules essential for postbinding and entry stages of infection such as modulation of microtubular dynamics, movement of virus in the cytoplasm, and nuclear delivery of viral DNA.",

However, research in this area has been hampered by the quiescence of the alveolar epithelium under standard culture conditions. Here, we used human distal airway epithelial cells (DAECs) to generate alveolar epithelial cells. Long-term, robust growth of human DAECs was achieved using co-culture with feeder cells and supplementation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y27632, and the Notch pathway inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ). Removal of feeders and priming with DBZ and a cocktail of lung maturation factors prevented the spontaneous differentiation into airway club cells and instead induced differentiation to alveolar epithelial cells. We successfully transferred this approach to chicken distal airway cells, thus generating a zoonotic infection model that enables studies on influenza A virus replication.

        "text": "Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt is an important cellular pathway that has been shown to participate in various replication steps of multiple viruses. In the present study, we compared the phosphorylation status of Akt during infection of MARC-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain HuN4. We observed that biphasic activation of Akt was induced in at both the early stage (5, 15 and 30 min postinfection) and the late stage (12 and 24 h postinfection) of HP-PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells, while an early-phase activation of Akt was found exclusively in virus-infected PAMs in vitro. Analysis with the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 confirmed that PI3K acted as the upstream activator for the virus-induced activation of Akt. UV-irradiation-inactivated virus still induced the early event in PAMs but not in MARC-145 cells, suggesting that different mechanisms are employed for the early-stage induction of phosphorylated Akt within different cell cultures. We further demonstrated that FoxO1 and Bad, which serve as downstream targets of Akt, were phosphorylated in virus-infected MARC-145 cells. Moreover, the suppression of phosphorylated Akt with LY294002 significantly inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells, but it had a negligible effect on virus propagation. Collectively, our data provide new evidence of a novel role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells.",

Using poliovirus as a model, we show that a long-range interaction between ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes formed at the ends of the viral genome is necessary for RNA replication. Initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis requires a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Strikingly, it also requires a cloverleaf-like RNA structure located at the other end of the genome. An RNP complex formed around the 5\u2032 cloverleaf RNA structure interacts with the poly(A) binding protein bound to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, thus linking the ends of the viral RNA and effectively circularizing it. Formation of this circular RNP complex is required for initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis. RNA circularization may be a general replication mechanism for positive stranded RNA viruses.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) makes it possible to perform intraperitoneal surgical procedures with a minimal number of access points in the abdominal wall. Currently, it is not possible to perform these interventions without the help of abdominal wall entryways, so these procedures are hybrids fusing minilaparoscopy and transluminal endoscopic surgery. This report presents a prospective clinical series of 25 patients who underwent transvaginal hybrid cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. METHODS The study comprised a clinical series of 25 consecutive nonrandomized women who underwent a fusion transvaginal NOTES and minilaparoscopy procedure with two trocars for cholelithiasis: one 5-mm umbilical trocar and one 3-mm trocar in the upper left quadrant. The study had no control group. RESULTS The scheduled surgical intervention was performed for all 25 women. No intraoperative complications occurred. One patient had mild hematuria that resolved in less than 12 h, but no other complications occurred during an average follow-up period of 140 days. Of the 25 women, 20 were discharged in 24 h, and 5 were discharged less than 12 h after the procedure. CONCLUSION Hybrid transvaginal cholecystectomy, combining NOTES and minilaparoscopy, is a good surgical model for minimally invasive surgery. It can be performed in surgical settings where laparoscopy is practiced regularly using the instruments normally used for endoscopy and laparoscopic surgery. Due to the reproducibility of the intervention and the ease of vaginal closure, hybrid transvaginal cholecystectomy will permit further development of NOTES in the future.",

We used serological methods and quantitative real-time PCR to test free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs for the presence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be highly aggressive in populations with low genetic diversity, such as cheetahs. We also assessed the presence of antibodies to other gammaretroviruses and the responses to a FeLV vaccine developed for domestic cats. Up to 19% of the free-ranging cheetahs, 27% of the captive nonvaccinated cheetahs, and 86% of the captive vaccinated cheetahs tested positive for FeLV antibodies. FeLV-antibody-positive free-ranging cheetahs also tested positive for Rauscher murine leukemia virus antibodies. Nevertheless, FeLV was not detectable by quantitative real-time PCR and no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay in the plasma of cheetahs or the supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of antibodies to gammaretroviruses in clinically healthy specimens may be caused either by infection with a low-pathogenic retrovirus or by the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences. The strong humoral immune responses to FeLV vaccination demonstrate that cheetahs can respond to the vaccine and that vaccination against FeLV infection may be beneficial should FeLV infection ever become a threat, as was seen in Iberian lynx and Florida panthers.",

Accordingly, a cross-sectional survey of 2768 households was conducted using a postal questionnaire. The 2006 Sydney residential phone book was used as the sampling frame. Non-responders were re-mailed the questionnaire on two further occasions, 2 and 4 weeks after the first posting. Completed questionnaires were received from 884 households. No pets were kept by 387 (43.8%) respondents. Dogs and cats were owned by 295 (33.4%) and 198 (22.5%) of households, respectively, with 7.8% of households having both cat(s) and dog(s). Fish and birds were the next most popular pets. Of the 198 cat-owning households, 54.0% kept only cat(s), while 46.5% kept cats with other pets. The distribution of cat ownership across Sydney was non-uniform. Each cat-owning household kept 1.3 cats on average, with the majority keeping one (75.8% households) or two (18.7%). For the 260 cats, the mean age was 7.1 years, the median 6 years, with a range of 3 months to 22 years. There were significantly more female (143; 55%) than male cats (117; 45%). Only seven cats (2.7%) were sexually entire, and these were all \u22646 years. Crossbred cats outnumbered pedigree cats by a ratio of 3.3:1. The Burmese was the most common breed, followed by the Persian. The median age of pedigree cats (5.5 years) was significantly lower than for domestic crossbred cats (7.0 years). Most cats were housed both indoors and outdoors (72.6%), with 19.7% being restricted to indoors and/or \u2018pet park enclosures\u2019. Pedigree cats were significantly more likely than crossbreds to be housed indoors. Most owners fed their cats a combination of commercial dry and canned food (38.1%), although fresh meat was popular also and either fed alone (1.6%) or in combination with dry food (14.4%), tinned food (1.6%) or canned and dry food (25.8%). A diet consisting of dry food alone was fed to cats in 13.4% of households. Ninety percent of cats had been vaccinated at least once, while 72.2% received a vaccination in the last 3 years. Older cats were less likely to have been vaccinated recently than younger cats. Only 5.8% of cats had never visited a veterinarian. For the 243 cats that had received veterinary attention, the average number of years since the last visit was 1.5.",

However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Liver centers should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplant programs need to consider offering some leniency to patients with AUD/ALD who cannot obtain alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Pneumonia refers to the inflammation of the terminal airway, alveoli and pulmonary interstitium, which can be caused by pathogenic microorganisms, physical and chemical factors, immune damage, and drugs. Anemoside B4, the major ingredient of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel, exhibited anti-inflammatory activity. However, the therapeutic effect of anemoside B4 on pneumonia has not been unraveled. This study aims to investigate that anemoside B4 attenuates the inflammatory responses in Klebsiella pneumonia (KP)- and influenza virus FM1 (FM1)-induced pneumonia mice model. METHODS: The network pharmacology and molecular docking assays were employed to predict the targets of anemoside B4\u2019s treatment of pneumonia. Two models (bacterial KP-infected mice and virus FM1-infected mice) were employed in our study. BALB/c mice were divided into six groups: control, model group (KP-induced pneumonia or FM1-induced pneumonia), anemoside B4 (B4)-treated group (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg), and positive drug group (ribavirin or ceftriaxone sodium injection). Blood samples were collected for hematology analysis. The effects of B4 on inflammation-associated mediators were investigated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) staining. Proteins expression was quantified by western blotting. RESULTS: The network results indicated that many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) participated in anemoside B4\u2019s anti-inflammatory activity. The counts of neutrophil (NEU) and white blood cell (WBC), the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 increased by KP or FM1 infection, which were reversed by anemoside B4. In addition, anemoside B4 significantly suppressed the FM1-induced expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), and myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), which were further validated by molecular docking data that anemoside B4 bound to bioactive sites of TLR4. Therefore, anemoside B4 exhibited a significant therapeutic effect on pneumonia via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that anemoside B4 attenuates pneumonia via the TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathway, suggesting that anemoside B4 is a promising therapeutic candidate for bacterial-infected or viral-infected pneumonia.",

        "text": "BACKGROUNDSince December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming a global threat. We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 \u00d7 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 \u00d7 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).",

We aimed to describe 3DARM values in asymptomatic volunteers and those with fecal incontinence (FI) or chronic constipation (CC), and identify which variables differentiate best these groups. METHODS Asymptomatic subjects were stratified by sex, age, and parity. Those with FI or CC were included according to anorectal symptom questionnaires. Endoanal ultrasound examination and 3DARM were performed the same day. Anal pressures were analyzed at rest, during voluntary squeeze, and during push maneuver, and compared between the 3 groups. Anal pressure defects were defined and compared to ultrasound defects. KEY RESULTS A total of 126 subjects (113 female, mean age 52 years, range 18-83) were included; 36 asymptomatic, 38 FI, 42 CC. Anal resting and squeeze pressures, and rectal sensitivity values were lower in FI women than in the other groups. Typical anal sphincter asymmetry during squeezing was less frequently observed in FI women. A dyssynergic pattern during push maneuver was found in 70% of asymptomatic subjects, and with a similar frequency in the 2 symptomatic groups. There was slight concordance between 3D-pressure defects and ultrasound defects. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES 3D anal pressures in asymptomatic women were significantly lower than in men, and in FI compared to asymptomatic women. The classical dyssynergic pattern during push maneuver was found as frequently in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.

        "text": "Abstract We have previously shown that cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) bind rabbit, mouse, and rat IgG by the Fc portion of the IgG molecule. This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc \u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-Fc\u03b3R monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine Fc\u03b3R. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the Fc\u03b3R mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-Fc\u03b3R monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND Acute myocardial infarction can be triggered by acute respiratory infections. Previous studies have suggested an association between influenza and acute myocardial infarction, but those studies used nonspecific measures of influenza infection or study designs that were susceptible to bias. We evaluated the association between laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and acute myocardial infarction. METHODS We used the self-controlled case-series design to evaluate the association between laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. We used various high-specificity laboratory methods to confirm influenza infection in respiratory specimens, and we ascertained hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction from administrative data. We defined the \"risk interval\" as the first 7 days after respiratory specimen collection and the \"control interval\" as 1 year before and 1 year after the risk interval. RESULTS We identified 364 hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction that occurred within 1 year before and 1 year after a positive test result for influenza. Of these, 20 (20.0 admissions per week) occurred during the risk interval and 344 (3.3 admissions per week) occurred during the control interval. The incidence ratio of an admission for acute myocardial infarction during the risk interval as compared with the control interval was 6.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.86 to 9.50). No increased incidence was observed after day 7. Incidence ratios for acute myocardial infarction within 7 days after detection of influenza B, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and other viruses were 10.11 (95% CI, 4.37 to 23.38), 5.17 (95% CI, 3.02 to 8.84), 3.51 (95% CI, 1.11 to 11.12), and 2.77 (95% CI, 1.23 to 6.24), respectively.

        "text": "BACKGROUND One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for cytokeratin 19 messenger RNA is an intraoperative diagnostic procedure for the detection of lymph node metastasis. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to construct intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis and four or more axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases. METHODS Of the 4736 breast cancer patients (T1-3, N0) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and had SLNs examined intraoperatively with OSNA, 623 with SLN metastasis treated with completion ALN dissection (cALND) were retrospectively analyzed, and were randomly divided into training (n = 312) and validation (n = 311) sets. RESULTS Of the clinicopathological parameters available preoperatively and intraoperatively, the multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that clinical tumor size and total tumor load (TTL) determined by OSNA were significantly associated with NSLN metastasis, and that clinical tumor size, number of macrometastatic SLNs, and TTL were significantly associated with four or more ALN metastases. Nomograms for NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases were constructed using these parameters, and their area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set were both 0.70, with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of previously reported postoperative nomograms. CONCLUSIONS We constructed intraoperative nomograms using OSNA for the prediction of NSLN metastasis and four or more ALN metastases. These nomograms are as accurate as the conventional postoperative nomograms and might be helpful for decision making regarding the indication for cALND or the choice of adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation field.",

        "text": "RATIONALE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat to health. Its inflammatory characteristics are incompletely understood. OBJECTIVES To define the cytokine profile of COVID-19, and to identify evidence of immunometabolic alterations in those with severe illness. METHODS Levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1) were assessed in plasma from healthy volunteers, hospitalized-but-stable COVID-19 patients (COVIDstable), COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (COVIDICU) and individuals with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU support (CAPICU). Immunometabolic markers were measured in circulating neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19. The acute phase response of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) to COVID-19 was also evaluated. MAIN RESULTS IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and sTNFR1 were all increased in patients with COVID-19. COVIDICU patients could be clearly differentiated from COVIDstable, and demonstrated higher levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and sTNFR1 - but lower IL-10 - than CAPICU. COVID-19 neutrophils displayed altered immunometabolism, with increased cytosolic PKM2, phosphorylated PKM2, HIF-1\u03b1 and lactate. The production and sialylation of AAT increased in COVID-19, but this anti-inflammatory response was overwhelmed in severe illness, with the IL-6:AAT ratio markedly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (P<0.0001). In critically unwell COVID-19 patients, increases in IL-6:AAT predicted prolonged ICU stay and mortality, while improvement in IL-6:AAT was associated with clinical resolution (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 cytokinemia is distinct from that of other types of pneumonia leading to organ failure and ICU need. Neutrophils undergo immunometabolic reprogramming in severe COVID-19 illness. Cytokine ratios may predict outcomes in this population.

        "text": "Abstract Objective To model and compare effect of digital contact tracing versus shelter-in-place on SARS-CoV-2 spread. Methods Using a classical epidemiologic framework, and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020 and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions- shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing- to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced, automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. Results Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in >90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. Conclusion Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.",

        "title": "Dexmedetomidine in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Protocols for Postoperative Pain",
        "text": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Effective acute pain management has evolved considerably in recent years and is a primary area of focus in attempts to defend against the opioid epidemic. Persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) has an incidence of up to 30\u201350% and has negative outcome of quality of life and negative burden on individuals, family, and society. The 2016 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines states that enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) forms an integral part of Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) and is now recommended to use a multimodal opioid-sparing approach for management of postoperative pain. As such, dexmedetomidine is now being used as part of ERAS protocols along with regional nerve blocks and other medications, to create a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced opioid consumption in the Post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RECENT FINDINGS: Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2) agonist, possesses analgesic effects and has a different mechanism of action when compared with opioids. When dexmedetomidine is initiated at the end of a procedure, it has a better hemodynamic stability and pain response than ropivacaine. Dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjuvant in epidurals with local anesthetic sparing effects. Its use during nerve blocks results in reduced postoperative pain. Also, local infiltration of IV dexmedetomidine is associated with earlier discharge from PACU. SUMMARY: Perioperative use of dexmedetomidine has significantly improved postoperative outcomes when used as part of ERAS protocols. An in-depth review of the use of dexmedetomidine in ERAS protocols is presented for clinical anesthesiologists.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize symptoms and disease severity among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, along with laboratory findings, imaging, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection were identified at two affiliated hospitals in New York City from March 13 to April 19, 2020, for this case series study. Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS: Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02). Asthma was more common among those with moderate or severe disease (24% vs 8%, OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.26-9.75). Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin. Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure. Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer. Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated. CONCLUSION: One in five pregnant women who contracted COVID-19 infection developed moderate or severe disease, including a small proportion with prolonged critical illness who received ICU or step-down-level care.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Studies in murine models suggested that platelet desialylation was an important mechanism of thrombocytopenia during sepsis. METHODS: First, we performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study that enrolled septic patients with or without thrombocytopenia to determine the association between platelet desialylation and thrombocytopenia in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Gender- and age-matched healthy adults were selected as normal controls in analysis of the platelet desialylation levels (study I). Next, we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the patients who had severe sepsis with thrombocytopenia (platelet counts \u226450 \u00d7 10(9)/L) were randomly assigned to receive antimicrobial therapy alone (control group) or antimicrobial therapy plus oseltamivir (oseltamivir group) in a 1:1 ratio (study II). The primary outcomes were platelet desialylation level at study entry, overall platelet response rate within 14 days post-randomization, and all-cause mortality within 28 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included platelet recovery time, the occurrence of bleeding events, and the amount of platelets transfused within 14 days post-randomization. RESULTS: The platelet desialylation levels increased significantly in the 127 septic patients with thrombocytopenia compared to the 134 patients without thrombocytopenia. A platelet response was achieved in 45 of the 54 patients in the oseltamivir group (83.3%) compared with 34 of the 52 patients in the control group (65.4%; P = 0.045). The median platelet recovery time was 5 days (interquartile range 4\u20136) in the oseltamivir group compared with 7 days (interquartile range 5\u201310) in the control group (P = 0.003). The amount of platelets transfused decreased significantly in the oseltamivir group compared to the control group (P = 0.044). There was no difference in the overall 28-day mortality regardless of whether oseltamivir was used. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and platelet recovery time were independent indicators of oseltamivir therapy. The main reason for all of the mortalities was multiple-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia was associated with increased platelet desialylation in septic patients. The addition of oseltamivir could significantly increase the platelet response rate, shorten platelet recovery time, and reduce platelet transfusion.

        "text": "Host susceptibility to respiratory tract infections (RTI) is dependent on both genetic and acquired risk factors. Repeated bacterial and viral RTI, such as pneumonia from encapsulated microorganisms, respiratory tract infections related to respiratory syncytial virus or influenza, and even the development of bronchiectasis and asthma, are often reported as the first symptom of primary immunodeficiencies. In the same way, neutropenia is a well-known risk factor for invasive aspergillosis, as well as lymphopenia for Pneumocystis, and mycobacterial infections. However, in the last decades a better knowledge of immune signaling networks and the introduction of next generation sequencing have increased the number and diversity of known inborn errors of immunity. On the other hand, the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha has revealed new risk groups for infections, such as tuberculosis. The use of biological response modifiers has spread to almost all medical specialties, including inflammatory diseases and neoplasia, and are being used to target different signaling networks that may mirror some of the known immune deficiencies. From a clinical perspective, the individual contribution of genetics, and/or targeted treatments, to immune dysregulation is difficult to assess. The aim of this article is to review the known and newly described mechanisms of impaired immune signaling that predispose to RTI, including new insights into host genetics and the impact of biological response modifiers, and to summarize clinical recommendations regarding vaccines and prophylactic treatments in order to prevent infections.",

Little is known about the mechanisms that govern the development of respiratory and neurological disease. Using a hamster model of lethal NiV and HeV infection, we describe the role of the route and dose of infection on the clinical outcome and determine virus tropism and host responses following infection. Infection of hamster with a high dose of NiV or HeV resulted in acute respiratory distress. NiV initially replicated in the upper respiratory tract epithelium, whereas HeV initiated infection primarily in the interstitium. In contrast, infection with a low dose of NiV or HeV resulted in the development of neurological signs and more systemic spread of the virus through involvement of the endothelium. The development of neurological signs coincided with disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and expression of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). In addition, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was identified as playing an important role in NiV and HeV pathogenesis.

Activity is expected to rebound sharply in H2, but even so the severity of the shock is likely to lead to a permanent GDP loss for the global economy. \u2580 While Chinese activity picked up in late\u2010Q1 as lockdown restrictions were unwound, we expect Q1 GDP to have fallen 12% q/q before rebounding sharply in Q2. But this Q2 boost looks set to be swamped by the collapse in activity caused by the rest of the world going into lockdown. \u2580 Although shutdown restrictions elsewhere are less severe than those imposed in China, business survey and labour market data still point to sharp falls in activity in most countries in Q2. Quarterly GDP declines of 8% or more in the US and eurozone seem likely. Overall, world GDP could fall by about 7% in H1, roughly double the size of the contraction during start of the global financial crisis in 2009. \u2580 In those economies subject to some form of lockdown, we expect restrictions to begin to be lifted during Q2. As a result, growth should resume in Q3 as sectors that have been forced to shut down see some pick\u2010up. But despite this rebound, world GDP is now seen shrinking 2.8% in 2020 overall \u2014 in 2009, the global GDP fall was 1.1%. \u2580 The H2 pick\u2010up, followed by a return to more normal conditions next year, will result in world GDP growth rising to almost 6% in 2021, helped also by the recent collapse in oil prices to about $30pb. But the scale of the disruption means that we expect a permanent loss of output from the shock. We expect global GDP in the medium term to be some 1.5% below the level we had anticipated before the coronavirus outbreak. \u2580 The risks around this forecast are large and broadly balanced. But were stringent lockdowns or widespread disruption, perhaps due to renewed outbreaks of the virus, to extend into Q3, global GDP could fall by as much as 8% this year.",

        "text": "Background. In many European countries and the US, the burden of Covid-19 epidemic could be much lower if Governments had been able to learn from the China and Lombardy stories and to declare full lockdown without delays. Methods. We use a simple game-theoretic framework for the strategic interaction between the Government, political oppositions and lobbies, combined with a Covid-19 transmission model, to analyse the role of political factors delaying the lockdown declaration, depending on the degrees of \"responsibility\" of political actors. Results. The lockdown can always be declared immediately (i.e., without delay) as sustained transmission arises, only if the government feels fully \"responsible\" towards all citizens. If this is not the case, epidemic growth will eventually dominate the agents' payoffs, so that sooner or later the lockdown will always be declared i.e., both the government and the opposition will be forced by the epidemic to switch towards a higher degree of responsibility, but with a delay. There is a further nontrivial situation where the lockdown can be declared without delay, occurring when the political opposition is at least as responsible as the Government. This however requires the solution of a coordination issue, which cannot be taken for granted. Eventually, a vicious circle emerges, where the delayed lockdown requires a much longer lockdown period to achieve adequate control results, thereby causing the explosion of economic losses and so calling for unlocking long before it should. Conclusions. Lockdown delays have dramatically worsened the impact of the current Covid-19 wave in a number of countries.

        "text": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW An international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a recently recognized syndrome caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, began in November 2002 and ended in July 2003. Since then, a large body of research on the syndrome has been published; the most updated developments are summarized here. RECENT FINDINGS Recent findings suggest that animal severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses may have been transmitted to humans without detection for years before the recent outbreak, and that such transmission may be continuing today. The 2002-2003 outbreak probably originated from similar animal-to-human transmission, but selection and purification of the animal severe acute respiratory syndrome-like virus appears to have occurred, creating the more virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Recent studies have documented that severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is primarily transmitted via contact and/or respiratory droplets and that the combination of standard, contact, and droplet precautions is generally effective for its control. It has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus is typically relatively inefficiently transmitted, with the notable exception of transmission during superspreading events. Insights into the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome have been made: one study suggests that human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*4601 is a possible risk factor for more severe disease, while another identifies angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Promising treatments have been identified, including interferons, an anti-spike monoclonal antibody, and fusion inhibitors. In addition, many promising vaccines are currently in development. SUMMARY New findings regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome are continuing to be discovered at an unprecedented pace, permitting a better understanding of the disease and enabling better preparation for its possible return.",

        "text": "RATIONALE: The family of natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), exert important and diverse actions for cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. The autocrine and paracrine functions of the NPs are primarily mediated through the cellular membrane bound guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors GC-A (NPR-A) and GC-B (NPR-B). As the ligands and receptors each contain disulfide bonds, a regulatory role for the cell surface protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was investigated. OBJECTIVE: We utilized complementary in vitro and in vivo models to determine the potential role of PDI in regulating the ability of the NPs to generate its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of PDI attenuated the ability of ANP, BNP and CNP to generate cGMP in human mesangial cells (HMCs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), each of which were shown to express PDI. In LLC-PK1 cells, where PDI expression was undetectable by immunoblotting, PDI inhibition had a minimal effect on cGMP generation. Addition of PDI to cultured LLC-PK1 cells increased intracellular cGMP generation mediated by ANP. Inhibition of PDI in vivo attenuated NP-mediated generation of cGMP by ANP. Surface Plasmon Resonance demonstrated modest and differential binding of the natriuretic peptides with immobilized PDI in a cell free system. However, PDI was shown to co-localize on the surface of cells with GC-A and GC-B by co-immunoprecpitation and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate for the first time that cell surface PDI expression and function regulate the capacity of natriuretic peptides to generate cGMP through interaction with their receptors.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVES Tracheal intubation of ICU patients is frequently associated with severe hypoxemia. Although noninvasive ventilation reduces desaturation during intubation of severely hypoxemic patients, it does not allow for per-procedure oxygenation and has not been evaluated in mild-to-moderate hypoxemic patients for whom high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may be an alternative. We sought to compare pre- and per-procedure oxygenation with either a nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask or a high-flow nasal cannula oxygen during tracheal intubation of ICU patients. DESIGN Prospective quasi-experimental before-after study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01699880). SETTING University hospital medico-surgical ICU. PATIENTS All adult patients requiring tracheal intubation in the ICU were eligible. INTERVENTIONS In the control (before) period, preoxygenation was performed with a nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask and in the change of practice (after) period, with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Primary outcome was median lowest SpO2 during intubation, and secondary outcomes were SpO2 after preoxygenation and number of patients with saturation less than 80%. One hundred one patients were included. Median lowest SpO2 during intubation were 94% (83-98.5) with the nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask versus 100% (95-100) with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (p < 0.0001). SpO2 values at the end of preoxygenation were higher with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen than with nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask and were correlated with the lowest SpO2 reached during the intubation procedure (r = 0.38, p < 0.0001). Patients in the nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask group experienced more episodes of severe hypoxemia (2% vs 14%, p = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis, preoxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen was an independent protective factor of the occurrence of severe hypoxemia (odds ratio, 0.146; 95% CI, 0.01-0.90; p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS High-flow nasal cannula oxygen significantly improved preoxygenation and reduced prevalence of severe hypoxemia compared with nonrebreathing bag reservoir facemask. Its use could improve patient safety during intubation.",

For these applications, it is critical to understand the in vivo interactions of CPMV within the mammalian system. Although the bioavailability of CPMV in the mouse has been demonstrated, the specific interactions between CPMV and mammalian cells need to be characterized further. Here we demonstrate that although the host range for replication of CPMV is confined to plants, mammalian cells nevertheless bind and internalize CPMV in significant amounts. This binding is mediated by a conserved 54-kDa protein found on the plasma membranes of both human and murine cell lines. Studies using a deficient cell line, deglycosidases, and glycosylation inhibitors showed that the CPMV binding protein (CPMV-BP) is not glycosylated. A possible 47-kDa isoform of the CPMV-BP was also detected in the organelle and nuclear subcellular fraction prepared from murine fibroblasts.

Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model is developed to study the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of non-linear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R0 was computed. The stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increase while placing interstates individuals and foreigners under quarantine, decreases the chances of exposure and subsequent infection, leading to an increase in the recovery rate. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, help in effectively controlling the epidemic.",

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Four geographically dispersed tertiary sleep disorder referral centers. METHODS Subjects with mild to moderate sleep apnea dissatisfied with CPAP because of pressure-related complaints were randomized to receive Pillar implants or a sham procedure performed in double-blind fashion. Active and sham groups were compared for changes in therapeutic CPAP pressures (primary outcome) with a 90-day follow-up sleep study and CPAP compliance (secondary outcome) with a 90-day smart card report. RESULTS Twenty-six subjects were randomized to Pillar implants and 25 to a sham implant procedure. There were no differences between groups with regard to demographics and baseline parameters. Both sham and active groups had reduced mean CPAP pressure (-1.1 vs -0.5 cm H(2)O) with no difference between groups (P = .32) at 90-day follow-up. In addition, there was no difference in average daily CPAP use between groups (P = .80). Both groups experienced improvements in Epworth sleepiness scores and Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire scores at 90 days with no differences between groups. The active group reported significantly higher CPAP satisfaction scores than the sham group (P = .04). CONCLUSION Pillar implants do not significantly reduce CPAP pressure or increase CPAP compliance compared to sham controls but may subjectively improve CPAP satisfaction.

No consensus exists on whether articulating instruments (ARTs) may help. This study evaluated their effect on simulated SILS, hypothesizing that they would affect performance and workload. DESIGN Surgeons were randomized to 2 straight instruments (STRs), 1 ART and 1 STR, or 2 ARTs. After baseline testing, 25 repetitions of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) peg-transfer (PEG) task and 5 repetitions of the short-hand for the FLS pattern-cutting task (CIRCLE) were performed. Primary outcomes were maximum FLS PEG scores, CIRCLE times and errors, and Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device hand motion analysis. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Raw Task Load Index (RTLX) questionnaires evaluated a secondary outcome--workload. SETTING The trial took place in a simulated operating theater within the Academic Surgical Unit at St Mary's Hospital, London, UK. PARTICIPANTS Eligible surgeons had completed at least 5 laparoscopic cases as a primary operator. Surgeons were stratified by laparoscopic experience into intermediate (less than 25 previous procedures as primary operator) or advanced (25 procedures or more). A total of 21 surgeons were recruited and randomized; 7 of them to each instrument combination group. All surgeons completed PEG, and 5 from each group completed CIRCLE. RESULTS Groups' baseline PEG scores were similar (p = 0.625). STR-ART achieved higher maximum PEG scores than STR or ART did (median = 236 vs 198 vs 193, respectively, p = 0.002). Fastest CIRCLE times were similar (median = 190s vs 130s vs 186s, p = 0.129) as were minimum errors (median = 1 vs 2 vs 3, p = 0.101). For PEG, Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device demonstrated similar total path lengths (median = 12.3m vs 12.3m vs 16.0m, p = 0.545) and total numbers of movements (median = 89.6 vs 86.4 vs 171, p = 0.080). Groups' NASA Raw Task Load Index scores were similar (p = 0.708). CONCLUSIONS Combining 1 STR and 1 ART improved SILS performance in the PEG task.

Epidemiological studies identified diabetes as the primary comorbidity associated with severe and/or lethal MERS-CoV infection. Understanding how diabetes affects MERS is important due to the global burden of diabetes and pandemic potential of MERS-CoV. We used a model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by expressing human DPP4 and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high fat diet. Upon infection with MERS-CoV, diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery which was independent of virus titers. Histological analysis revealed that diabetic mice had delayed inflammation which was then prolonged through 21 dpi. Diabetic mice had fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and CD4+ T cells which correlated with lower levels of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 expression. Diabetic mice also had lower levels of Tnfa, Il6, Il12b, and Arg1 expression and higher levels of Il17a expression. These data suggest that the increased disease severity observed in individuals with MERS and comorbid type 2 diabetes is likely due to a dysregulated immune response which results in more severe and prolonged lung pathology.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of two different pulse oximeter technologies by comparing the time taken to achieve reliable oxygen saturation readings during neonatal transition. METHODS This cross-sectional study was done to compare the performance of two pulse oximeter technologies - Signal Extraction Technology (SET), and Resistor Calibration (RCAL) technology on 150 inborn, term neonates at birth. Probes of both pulse oximeters were connected to the pre-ductal limb and the time taken to obtain a reliable reading was recorded. Sequential saturation values were recorded every minute till ten minutes of life. Statistical analysis was done with Mann-Whitney U test and intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. RESULTS Pulse oximeter with SET recorded reliable readings faster than RCAL technology - Median (IQR) 32 (21-60)s vs. 45 (21.75-105)s, p = 0.021. There was a significant difference in the time to record first saturation readings of the two pulse oximeters when used in normal deliveries [RCAL vs. SET-Median (IQR) 50s (25-120.75) vs. 32.5s (21.75-58.25), p = 0.004] but no such difference was observed in Lower Segment Cesarean section (LSCS) [RCAL vs. SET Median (IQR) 35.5s (18.25-70.75) vs. 31s (20-69.75), p = 0.968]. Sequential saturation readings for every minute for the first 10 min of life were higher with SET vs. RCAL technology. The intraclass correlation coefficient between both pulse oximeters, for each minute, was poor (r < 0.80). CONCLUSIONS The SET pulse oximeter picked up first saturation values faster than the RCAL technology pulse oximeters. Studies are needed to evaluate effect of this on decisions made during neonatal resuscitation.",

These multiple infections suggested underlying immunodeficiency, perhaps caused by concurrent infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV); so blood samples were collected for serology, serum protein electrophoresis, lymphocyte proliferation assays, and cytokine analysis by reverse transcriptase-quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (RT-qcPCR). Resulting data were compared with data from FIV-infected and control domestic short-haired cats. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures were propagated to detect FIV virus by both RT-qcPCR and detection of reverse transcriptase activity. Serum protein electrophoresis showed that four of six Pallas' cats had increased alpha, globulins. At least two Pallas' cats had decreased lymphoproliferation responses to mitogen. and all three tested animals exhibited defective interleukin-12 gene expression. Although these clinical and laboratory findings suggested an immunodeficiency syndrome, FIV infection could not be confirmed. On the basis of repeated blood test results, it can be concluded that nutritional, metabolic, or other systemic problems probably did not contribute to the disease syndrome.

Calves were monitored from days 1 to 5, and on day 6 (neonates) or 8 (weanlings) and, in a second trial at day 4\u00b75, by histology, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and virus isolation. Mucosal lesions of neonates were similar to, but less extensive than, those of weanling calves. Loss of microvilli and goblet cells, with minimal epithelial erosions as early as day 1, progressed to necrosis of epithelium and adjacent lymphoid tissue, and leucocyte exudation. Lesions and clinical disease were progressive up to and including day 6 in neonates, but resolving in weanlings on days 5 and 8. By transmission electron microscopy, the physical characteristics of the phagocytic cells appeared similar in both age groups, and viral replication was not identified in leucocytes. Virus was isolated from, or found by immunocytochemistry in, the pharyngeal tonsil of all calves examined, except for two weanlings on days 1 and 8. Virus as detected by immunocytochemistry was restricted to epithelium and superficial lymphoid tissue in neonates, but was found in deep lymphoid tissue around germinal centres in weanlings. The study showed that the pharyngeal tonsil is readily infected with BHV-1 and may be an important lymphoid tissue for early anti-viral responses.

        "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurovirulent coronavirus that can cause nervous symptoms in piglets with muscle tremors, hind limb paralysis, and nystagmus. Whether some factors affect virus replication and proliferation had not been fully understood in the course of nerve damage caused by PHEV infection. In recent years, some reports suggested that miRNA might play a key regulatory role in viral infection. In this study, we found the miR-21a-5p is notably up-regulated in the brains of mice and N2a cells infected with PHEV, and it down-regulated the expression of CASK-interactive protein1 (Caskin1) by directly targeting the 3\u2032-UTR of Caskin1 using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The over-expression of miR-21a-5p or Caskin1 knockdown in the host significantly contributes to PHEV proliferation. Conversely, the silencing of miR-21a-5p by miR-21a-5p inhibitors suppressed the virus proliferation. Taken together, our results indicate that Caskin1 is the direct target gene of miR-21a-5p, and it is advantageous to virus proliferation by down-regulating Caskin1. These findings may help in the development of strategies for therapeutic applications.",

METHODS: This retrospective, single-center analysis included all the patients consecutively admitted to our Hospital with severe or critical COVID-19 who started TCZ treatment from March 13th to April 03rd, 2020. A 1:2 matching to patients not treated with TCZ was performed according to age, sex, severity of disease, P/F, Charlson Comorbidity Index and length of time between symptoms onset and hospital admittance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests to compare the groups were applied. Kaplan Meier probability curves and Cox regression models for survival, hospital discharge and orotracheal intubation were used. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients treated with TCZ were matched with 148 matched controls. They were mainly males (81.5%), Caucasian (82.0%) and with a median age of 59 years. The majority (69.8%) showed critical stage COVID-19 disease. TCZ use was associated with a better overall survival (HR 0.499 [95% CI 0.262-0.952], p=0.035) compared to controls but with a longer hospital stay (HR 1.658 [95% CI 1.088-2.524], p=0.019) mainly due to biochemical, respiratory and infectious adverse events. DISCUSSION: TCZ use resulted potentially effective on COVID-19 in terms of overall survival. Caution is warranted given the potential occurrence of adverse events. FINANCIAL SUPPORT: Some of the tocilizumab doses used in the subjects included in this analysis were provided by the \"Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\" (EudraCT Number: 2020-001110-38) supported by the Italian National Agency for Drugs (AIFA). No specific funding support was planned for study design, data collection and analysis and manuscript writing of this paper.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND Stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a common occurrence. We have previously presented data demonstrating that the use of a 25-mm circular stapler results in a decreased incidence of stenosis compared to the results of a 21-mm circular stapler (6.2 vs. 15.9%, P=0.03). One potential drawback of the larger-diameter stapler is the possibility for impaired long-term weight loss due to decreased restriction. We sought to determine the impact of circular stapler diameter on excess weight loss up to 5 years after surgery. METHODS Our initial technique for creating the gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic gastric bypass involved the transgastric passage of a 21-mm circular stapler anvil (group 1). After a large initial experience, we switched to a 25-mm circular stapler (group 2). Follow-up data were entered prospectively into a computer database. Weight loss was recorded as percent of excess weight lost. Only patients with follow-up beyond 3 years postoperatively were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS Group 1 consisted of 145 consecutive patients and group 2 consisted of 116 consecutive patients. There was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups at 3 (66.1 vs. 65.2%, P=0.76, n=134), 4 (66.4 vs. 58.6%, P=0.1, n=66), and 5 years after gastric bypass (62.7 vs. 57.5%, P=0.24, n=75). CONCLUSIONS The use of a 25-mm circular stapler in laparoscopic gastric bypass operations instead of a 21-mm stapler does not result in significantly different long-term weight loss. The 25-mm stapler is preferred with our technique.",

Studies\u2019 quality assessments were performed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. A total of 37 studies were included, involving 275 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 248 neonates. The majority of pregnant women presented with mild to moderate symptoms, only 10 were admitted in the ICU, and one died. Two stillbirths were reported and the incidence of prematurity was 28%. Sixteen neonates were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and nine of them were born from mothers infected during pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes were generally good: all the affected neonates recovered. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 yielded negative results on amniotic fluid, vaginal/cervical fluids, placenta tissue, and breast milk samples. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women appeared associated with mild or moderate disease in most cases, with a low morbidity and mortality rate. The outcomes of neonates born from infected women were mainly favorable, although neonates at risk should be closely monitored.

ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources toward this endeavor. Here we provide novel, genome-scale tools for the study of Candida albicans, a commensal yeast that is also responsible for frequent superficial and disseminated infections in humans. We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5099 ORFs cloned in a Gateway\u2122 donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein\u2013protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway\u2122-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment.

METHODS A pooled analysis of safety data from seven multicenter, randomized, blinded, Phase III clinical trials (4-12 weeks' duration) of TDiclo was conducted. The analysis focused on a subset of patients (n = 280) aged 75 years or older with a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee (six trials) or hand (one trial). Patients received one of three topical treatments: TDiclo (n = 138); placebo (2.33% or 4.55% dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 39); or control (45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 103). Treatment groups were compared using Chi-square analysis, Fisher's Exact test, or analysis of variance. RESULTS The most common adverse events involved the skin or subcutaneous tissue, primarily at the application site. The incidence of dry skin was higher in the TDiclo (36.2%; P < 0.0001) and dimethyl sulfoxide control (18.4%; P = 0.0142) groups than in the placebo group (2.6%); the incidence of other skin or subcutaneous tissue adverse events was similar between the groups. Relatively few patients (<18%) experienced gastrointestinal adverse events, and group differences were not detected. In the TDiclo group, constipation (3.6%), diarrhea (3.6%), and nausea (3.6%) were the most common gastrointestinal adverse events. Cardiovascular and renal/ urinary adverse events were rare, and group differences were not detected. There was one case (0.7%) each of hypertension, spider veins, and vasodilation in the TDiclo group. Changes from baseline to the final visit in blood pressure and hepatic/renal enzyme levels were also similar between the groups.

In this study, NS1 protein was expressed in prokaryotic expression system and purified. One mAb against NS1 protein was generated from Balb/c mice immunized with recombinant protein NS1. A set of 35 partially-overlapping polypeptides covering the entire NS1 protein was expressed with PGEX-6P-1 vector and screened with mAb 3G2. One polypeptide against the mAb was acquired and identified by indirect ELISA and western-blot. To map the epitope accurately, one or two amino acid residues were removed from the carboxy and amino terminal of polypeptide sequentially. A series of truncated oligopeptides were expressed and purified. The minimal determinant of the linear B cell epitope was recognized and identified with mAb 3G2. The accurate linear B-cell epitope was (269)DEKEIV(274) located in NS1 protein. Furthermore, sequence alignment showed that the epitope was highly conserved and specific among TMUV strains and other flavivirus respectively.

        "text": "INTRODUCTION The world's older population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. An ageing population poses a great challenge to our healthcare system that requires new tool to tackle the complexity of health services as well as the increasing expenses. Mobile health applications (mHealth app) is seen to have the potential to address these challenges, alleviating burdens on the healthcare system and enhance the quality of life for older adults. Despite the numerous benefits of mHealth apps, relatively little is known about whether older adults perceive that these apps confer such benefits. Their perspectives towards the use of mobile applications for health-related purposes have also been little studied. Therefore, in this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review literature specific to older adults' willingness, perceived barriers and motivators towards the use of mobile applications to monitor and manage their health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology framework will guide the conduct of this scoping review. The search strategy will involve electronic databases including PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect, in addition to grey literature sources and hand-searching of reference lists. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. Data will be charted and sorted through an iterative process by the research team. The extracted data will undergo a descriptive analysis and simple quantitative analysis will be conducted using descriptive statistics. Engagement with relevant stakeholders will be carried out to gain more insights into our data from different perspectives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Since the data used are from publicly available sources, this study does not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through academic journals, conferences and seminars. We anticipate that our findings will aid technology developers and health professionals working in the area of ageing and rehabilitation.",

        "text": "INTRODUCTION Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) overexpression supports proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer (PC). Radionuclide molecular imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated PC would aid in the selection of patients who are likely responders to HER2 targeting therapy. In this study, we evaluated whether ABY-025 Affibody molecule, a small (\u223c 7-kDa) HER2-binding scaffold protein, produces superior tumor-to-nontumor ratios compared with those obtained through the use of radiolabeled humanized anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab. The influence of (111)In vs. (125)I radiolabel was evaluated for both tracers. METHODS ABY-025 was labeled with (111)In using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid chelator, site-specifically coupled to the C-terminus via the maleimido derivative. Trastuzumab was labeled with (111)In using a CHX-A\u2033 diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelator. An indirect radioiodination with [(125)I]-N-succinimidyl-para-iodobenzoate was used for both targeting proteins. Biodistribution of all labeled targeting proteins was evaluated in mice bearing DU-145 PC xenografts. RESULTS The use of residualizing (111)In-label facilitated better tumor uptake and better tumor-to-nontumor ratios for both targeting agents. [(111)In]-ABY-025 provided tumor uptake of 7.1\u00b10.8% injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) and tumor-to-blood ratio of 47\u00b113 already at 6 h postinjection. The maximum tumor-to-nontumor ratios with [(111)In]-CHX-DTPA-trastuzumab were achieved at 72 h postinjection, whereas tumor uptake was 11\u00b14% ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratio was 18\u00b17. The biodistribution data were confirmed with gamma-camera imaging. CONCLUSIONS Radiolabeled ABY-025 Affibody molecule provides higher contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than radiolabeled trastuzumab. Residualizing radiometal label for ABY-025 provides better contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than nonresidualizing radiohalogen.",

The many scaling exponents, \u03b1, reported in the literature usually require detailed interpretations concerning each particular system under study. Here, we critically evaluate the predictive power of scaling exponents by analyzing conductance measurements in four biological channels with contrasting architectures. We show that scaling behavior depends on several interconnected effects whose contributions change with concentration so that the use of oversimplified models missing critical factors could be misleading. In fact, the presence of interfacial effects could give rise to an apparent universal scaling that hides the channel distinctive features. We complement our study with 3D structure-based Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) calculations, giving results in line with experiments and validating scaling arguments. Our findings not only provide a unified framework for the study of ion transport in confined geometries but also highlight that scaling arguments are powerful and simple tools with which to offer a comprehensive perspective of complex systems, especially those in which the actual structure is unknown.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE Major depressive disorder is associated with aberrant resting-state functional connectivity across multiple brain networks supporting emotion processing, executive function, and reward processing. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patterns of resting-state connectivity between brain regions predict differential outcome to antidepressant medication (sertraline) compared with placebo. METHODS Participants in the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI at baseline. Participants were then randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo treatment for 8 weeks (N=279). A region of interest-based approach was utilized to compute functional connectivity between brain regions. Linear mixed-model intent-to-treat analyses were used to identify brain regions that moderated (i.e., differentially predicted) outcomes between the sertraline and placebo arms. RESULTS Prediction of response to sertraline involved several within- and between-network connectivity patterns. In general, higher connectivity within the default mode network predicted better outcomes specifically for sertraline, as did greater between-network connectivity of the default mode and executive control networks. In contrast, both placebo and sertraline outcomes were predicted (in opposite directions) by between-network hippocampal connectivity. CONCLUSIONS This study identified specific functional network-based moderators of treatment outcome involving brain networks known to be affected by major depression. Specifically, functional connectivity patterns of brain regions between and within networks appear to play an important role in identifying a favorable response for a drug treatment for major depressive disorder.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Porosity and pore density (PD) are important characteristics of flow diverters (FDs), because they may influence device efficacy and safety. Reliable measurement of these parameters would seem to be required for comparisons between devices, device selection at the time of clinical usage, as well as for research purposes. Because there is no standard method of measurement, our aim was to assess the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of PD measurements and of three different ways of measuring porosity. METHODS Six microphotographs of two fully deployed FDs were taken overlying two different millimetric reference grids: one flat and the other corrected to match the cylindrical stent. Standardized protocols for independently measuring PD and porosity according to three different methods were used by three trained observers and by the same observer twice. Bland-Altman plots and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to study the reliability of the measurements. RESULTS For porosity, satisfactory agreement occurred only when the same method of measurement was performed by the same observer. Intra-observer and inter-observer agreement were poor for measures of porosity when different methods were used (with differences in the range of 5-10%, ICC <0.6 for all methods). Measurement of PD was more reliable within (ICC 0.991 (0.946 to 0.999)) and between (ICC 0.945 (0.781 to 0.991)) observers. CONCLUSIONS Without standardization, the porosity of different devices cannot reliably be compared because use of different methods or different observers substantially changes results.

        "text": "OBJECTIVE The Enterprise stent is the first closed-cell stent designed to treat wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Advantages of the design can include improvement in keeping coils within an aneurysm and the ability of the stent to be recaptured. We compared the technical and clinical complications of the Enterprise stent with the open-cell Neuroform stent, its primary alternative. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing Enterprise and Neuroform stent-assisted aneurysm coiling were enrolled in prospective registries starting in March 2007 and February 2003, respectively. All consecutive patients through December 2011 were included. Deployment success and difficulty, stent movement and misplacement, and procedural complications were compared. RESULTS Enterprise deployment success was high (108 of 115 attempts, 93.9%) with 102 aneurysms receiving a stent compared with Neuroform (173 of 214 attempts, 80.8%, p = 0.001) with 163 aneurysms. Enterprise was easier to deploy (1.7% vs 15.9% difficult deployment, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the rates of stent movement, misplacement, or symptomatic hemorrhage. Symptomatic thromboembolic events, however, were more frequent with the Enterprise stent (8.7% vs 1.4%, p = 0.0021). The Enterprise stent enabled treatment of 10 additional aneurysms that could not be treated with Neuroform and had a higher rate of immediate aneurysm occlusion (87.3% vs 73.0%, p = 0.0058). CONCLUSION Enterprise was easier to deploy and enabled treatment of additional aneurysms; however, there were more thromboembolic complications. On the basis of these findings, we prefer to use the Neuroform stent first and rely on the Enterprise stent as an easy-to-deliver backup for stent-assisted coiling.",

In the UK, the NHS Direct telephone service was used by many of these patients. We used qualitative interviews to identify the main reasons why people approached NHS Direct with concerns about swine flu and to identify aspects of their contact which were reassuring, using a framework approach. METHODS: 33 patients participated in semi-structured interviews. All patients had telephoned NHS Direct between 11 and 14 May with concerns about swine flu and had been assessed as being unlikely to have the illness. RESULTS: Reasons for seeking advice about swine flu included: the presence of unexpectedly severe flu-like symptoms; uncertainties about how one can catch swine flu; concern about giving it to others; pressure from friends or employers; and seeking 'peace of mind.' Most participants found speaking to NHS Direct reassuring or useful. Helpful aspects included: having swine flu ruled out; receiving an alternative explanation for symptoms; clarification on how swine flu is transmitted; and the perceived credibility of NHS Direct. No-one reported anything that had increased their anxiety and only one participant subsequently sought additional advice about swine flu from elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Future major incidents involving other forms of chemical, biological or radiological hazards may also cause large numbers of unexposed people to seek health advice. Our data suggest that providing telephone triage and information is helpful in such instances, particularly where advice can be given via a trusted, pre-existing service.",

CCL28, \u03b2- or CC chemokine, is involved in the host immunity at various epithelial and mucosal linings. The unique roles of CCL28 in several facets of immune responses have attracted considerable attention and may represent a promising approach to combat various infections. CCL28 displays a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi. Here, we will summarize various research findings regarding the antimicrobial activity of CCL28 and the relevant mechanisms behind it. We will explore how the structure of CCL28 is involved with this activity and how this function may have evolved. CCL28 displays strong homing capabilities for B and T cells at several mucosal and epithelial sites, and orchestrates the trafficking and functioning of lymphocytes. The chemotactic and immunomodulatory features of CCL28 through the interactions with its chemokine receptors, CCR10 and CCR3, will also be discussed in detail.

During three consecutive trials (PSV first trial--PSV1, followed by PAV+, followed by a second PSV trial--PSV2, with the same settings as PSV1) we evaluated mechanical and patient respiratory pattern; inspiratory effort from excursion Pdi (swing(Pdi)), and pressure-time products of the transdiaphragmatic (PTPdi) pressures. Inspiratory (delay(trinsp)) and expiratory (delay(trexp)) trigger delays, time of synchrony (time(syn)), and asynchrony index (AI) were assessed. RESULTS Compared to PAV+, during PSV trials, the mechanical inspiratory time (Ti(flow)) was significantly longer than patient inspiratory time (Ti(pat)) (p < 0.05); Ti(pat) showed a prolongation between PSV1 and PAV+, significant comparing PAV+ and PSV2 (p < 0.05). PAV+ significantly reduced delay(trexp) (p < 0.001). The portion of tidal volume (VT) delivered in phase with Ti(pat) (VT(pat)/VT(mecc)) was significantly higher during PAV+ (p < 0.01). The time of synchrony was significantly longer during PAV+ than during PSV (p < 0.001). During PSV 5 patients out of 11 showed an AI greater than 10%, whereas the AI was nil during PAV+.

In this study, we describe a method for the swift generation of a human-derived monoclonal antibody, known as LCA60, as a treatment for MERS infections. LCA60 antibody was generated using the Cellclone Technology from the immortalized B cells of a human donor recovering from MERS. Only four months were required from the initial screening of B cells to the development of a stable CHO cell line suitable for the production of clinical grade antibody, thereby delineating a rapid pathway for the development of antiviral therapies against emerging viruses.

        "text": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put tremendous pressure on the healthcare system worldwide. Diagnostic testing remained one of the limiting factors for early identification and isolation of infected patients. This study aimed to evaluate posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POPS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. METHODS: The laboratory information system was searched retrospectively for all respiratory specimens and POPS requested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between Feb 1, 2020 and Apr 15, 2020. The agreement and diagnostic performance of POPS against NPsp were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 13772 specimens were identified during the study period, including 2130 POPS and 8438 NPsp. Two hundred and twenty-nine same-day POPS-NPsp paired were identified with POPS and NPsp positivity of 61.5% (95% CI [55.1\u201367.6%]) and 53.3% (95% CI [46.8\u201359.6%]). The overall, negative and positive percent agreement were 76.0% (95% CI [70.2\u201380.9%]), 65.4% (95% CI [55.5\u201374.2%]), 85.2% (95% CI [77.4\u201390.8%]). Better positive percent agreement was observed in POPS-NPsp obtained within seven days (96.6%, 95% CI [87.3\u201399.4%]) compared with after seven days of symptom onset (75.0%, 95% CI [61.4\u201385.2%)). Among the 104 positive pairs, the mean difference in Cp value was 0.26 (range: 12.63 to -14.74), with an overall higher Cp value in NPsp (Pearson coefficient 0.579). No significant temporal variation was noted between the two specimen types. CONCLUSIONS: POPS is an acceptable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, we find that ethnic diversity is positively associated with gambling. This result is robust to alternative estimation approaches, alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and irrespective of whether gambling is measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index, gambling expenditures or number of gambling activities. Our results also suggest stronger effects of ethnic diversity for problem gamblers compared to gamblers in other risk categories.

METHODS The clinical data of 94 SARS cases treated during the outbreak of SARS in South China in 2003 were collected for a retrospective review. According to different treatment regimens, the patients were divided into hormone group (n=35) and non-hormone group (n=59). The control groups consisted of 65 patients with interstitial pneumonia, 78 with bacterial pneumonia and 57 with upper respiratory tract infection. The changes in body temperature were compared between the SARS patients and those with other respiratory diseases and the effect of glucocorticoid hormone on controlling body temperature of the SARS patients was explored. RESULTS The body temperature of patients with the 4 diseases all exhibited obvious reduction 7 days after hospitalization (P<0.001) with only subsequent mild fluctuation within the basically normal range. At each time point of measurement, the body temperature of SARS patients was significantly higher than that of patients with other diseases (P<0.03), with a fluctuation of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C; and following a pattern of variation similar to those of the other diseases. Of the 4 time points of daily measurement, namely 6, 10, 14 and 18 o'clock, the temperature measured at 14 o'clock was significantly higher than those at the other 3 time points (P<0.001). Hormone therapy did not significantly affect the temperature of SARS patients (P=0.180), who had longer duration of high fever.

        "text": "Approximately 20,000\u201330,000 measles patients were reported in a surveillance of infectious diseases because of low vaccine coverage of 80% in Japan. Among them, some were thought to be secondary vaccine failure (SVF) with generally mild or non\u2010typical measles illness and sometimes became a source of further transmission. We have developed a new, sensitive, and rapid method to detect the measles virus genome by reverse transcription loop\u2010mediated isothermal amplification (RT\u2010LAMP). We examined 50 nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples that were obtained during the 1999 outbreak and stored at \u221270\u00b0C and fresh NPS, lymphocytes and sera from 11 patients in 2003. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and RT\u2010LAMP. We detected the genomic RNA corresponding to at least 0.01\u20130.04 TCID50, 30\u2013100 copies in samples by RT\u2010LAMP within 60 min after extraction of RNA, and all four genotypes isolated in Japan were equally amplified. Specific DNA amplification was monitored spectrophotometrically by real time turbidimeter and the quantity of RNA was calculated. Measles virus genome was detected in 44 of 50 stored NPS by RT\u2010PCR and in 49 by RT\u2010LAMP. The vaccine strain was discriminated from wild strains after sequencing the LAMP products. RT\u2010LAMP is a useful rapid diagnostic method for the detection of measles virus without any special apparatus, showing higher sensitivity than RT\u2010PCR, and expected to be applied for hospital\u2010based infection control and for laboratory\u2010based measles surveillance.

        "text": "INTRODUCTION In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed to predict tissue outcome in acute stroke patients using machine learning methods incorporating multiparametric imaging data. Most methods include diffusion and perfusion parameters as image-based parameters but do not include any spatial information although these parameters are spatially dependent, e.g. different perfusion properties in white and gray brain matter. This study aims to investigate if including spatial features improves the accuracy of multi-parametric tissue outcome prediction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Acute and follow-up multi-center MRI datasets of 99 patients were available for this study. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost machine learning models were trained and tested using acute MR diffusion and perfusion features and known follow-up lesions. Different combinations of atlas coordinates and lesion probability maps were included as spatial information. The stroke lesion predictions were compared to the true tissue outcomes using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the Dice metric. RESULTS The statistical analysis revealed that including spatial features significantly improves the tissue outcome prediction. Overall, the XGBoost and random forest models performed best in every setting and achieved state-of-the-art results regarding both metrics with similar improvements achieved including Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space coordinates or voxel-wise lesion probabilities. CONCLUSION Spatial features should be integrated to improve lesion outcome prediction using machine learning models.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate immunogenicity in the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses to genetic vaccines of the recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-N gene expressing the same protein plasmid, pcDNA3.1-N, and replication-defective adenoviral vector, rAd-N, in a pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen and the reverse sequence in a rAd-N prime-pcDNA3.1-N boost regimen. METHOD: After the mice had been immunized intramuscularly and/or intraperitoneally with pcDNA3.1-N and rAd-N in prime-triple boost immunization, humoral and cellular immune responses were detected. RESULTS: After detection, different levels of anti-N humoral and cellular responses are shown compared to controls. The humoral immune response was induced more effectively by the DNA priming and recombinant adenovirus boosting regimen and the reverse sequence of heterogeneous combinations. There is a significant difference between heterogeneous and homologous vaccinations. However, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response was not significantly altered by the different prime-boost immunizations or the recombinant adenovirus of pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen alone, but lymphoproliferation and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) secretion were all enhanced by heterologous combination immunizations compared to homologous combinations. For the reverse sequence immunization regimen, lymphoproliferation, IFN-\u03b3 and CTL responses were all significantly weaker compared with pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen. CONCLUSION: Taken together, of all the combinations, the prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N can effectively induce SARS-CoV-N-specific and strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.

Accordingly, various measures by the higher education providers have been initiated to implement social isolation strategies, and online teaching is followed with rapid curriculum transformation. The online delivery is more convenient, as it can provide vibrant and dynamic teaching and learning environment. However, due to time constraint, the curriculum transformation is anticipated to occur rapidly without sufficient preparation. Therefore, in this study, the concept of the emergency remote teaching (ERT) including its application and evaluation is thoroughly discussed. The application of the ERT in the Middle East College Oman has been considered as case study. This study draws on CIPP evaluation model to assess the effectiveness of the adopted model, and qualitative data were collected online taking random samples of students and educators. Besides, interview and questionnaire responses, experiences, beliefs, and challenges encountered by the educators and students on the emergency remote teaching were used and analyzed. In addition, students\u2019 weekly attendance segregated with session modes, levels and module nature were considered to evaluate the students\u2019 participation to the online classes.

The study was a 12-month multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study of patients with asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory infections and minimal symptoms between episodes. Patients were randomized to receive oral montelukast 4 or 5 mg (depending on age) (n = 278) or placebo (n = 271) once per day for 12 months.

Over 12 months of therapy, montelukast significantly reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 31.9% compared with placebo. The average rate of exacerbation episodes per patient was 1.60 episodes per year on montelukast compared with 2.34 episodes on placebo. Montelukast also delayed the median time to first exacerbation by approximately 2 months (p = 0.024), and the rate of inhaled corticosteroid courses (p = 0.027) compared with placebo.

To assess the clinical importance of this virus in infants and children, we developed a rapid and efficient reverse transcription-PCR-based screening method for a large volume of samples and tested retrospectively a collection of 1,132 respiratory specimens submitted over a full year period to the virology laboratory of a large tertiary care pediatric center in Montreal, Canada. A total of 41 samples from 37 patients were positive by this method. During the winter months of 2001, up to 8% of specimens submitted for respiratory virus testing were hMPV positive. Sequencing data of the hMPV M gene revealed that two genogroups of the virus, each of which can be divided into two subgroups, cocirculated during this time period. A case-controlled study was conducted to compare the symptoms associated with hMPV infection with those involving other etiologic agents causing ARTI. Symptoms most frequently observed in hMPV-positive patients were cough, wheezing, and dyspnea, although the symptomatology could differ substantially from patient to patient. No distinct symptom profile could be associated with hMPV. Three nosocomial cases of hMPV infection were identified. Together, our data suggest that hMPV is a significant cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infections in infants and children.

Here, we investigated the molecular characteristics of GARs that caused four outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year. G and P genotyping of GARs detected at each outbreak demonstrated genetic diversity in this farm as follows: G9P[23] was detected at the first outbreak, G9P[13]/[22] and G9P[23] at the second, G3P[7] at the third, and G9P[23], G5P[13]/[22], and P[7] combined with an untypeable G genotype at the fourth. Sequence analysis of the detected GARs revealed that such genetic diversity could have resulted not only from the introduction of new GAR strains, but also from gene reassortment between GAR strains within the farm. Further, the GAR strain carrying the untypeable G genotype was shown to be a novel porcine GAR bearing a new G26 genotype, as confirmed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.",

In response, US officials augmented existing radiological screening at its ports of entry (POEs) to detect and decontaminate travelers contaminated with radioactive materials. During March 12 to 16, radiation screening protocols detected 3 travelers from Japan with external radioactive material contamination at 2 air POEs. Beginning March 23, federal officials collaborated with state and local public health and radiation control authorities to enhance screening and decontamination protocols at POEs. Approximately 543 000 (99%) travelers arriving directly from Japan at 25 US airports were screened for radiation contamination from March 17 to April 30, and no traveler was detected with contamination sufficient to require a large-scale public health response. The response highlighted synergistic collaboration across government levels and leveraged screening methods already in place at POEs, leading to rapid protocol implementation. Policy development, planning, training, and exercising response protocols and the establishment of federal authority to compel decontamination of travelers are needed for future radiological responses.

Broiler chickens were subcutaneously immunized with isotonic saline (control), Eimeria recombinant profilin alone, or profilin emulsified with QCDC at 1 and 7 days post-hatch, and orally challenged with live Eimeria acervulina at 7 days following the last immunization. Body weight gains, gut lesion scores, fecal oocyst outputs, profilin serum antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation, and intestinal cytokine transcript levels were assessed as measures of protective immunity. Chickens immunized with profilin plus QCDC showed increased body weight gains and decreased intestinal lesion scores compared with the profilin only or control groups. However, no differences were found in fecal oocyst shedding among the three groups. Profilin serum antibody titers and antigen-induced peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in the profilin/QCDC group were higher compared with the profilin only and control groups. Finally, while immunization with profilin alone or profilin plus QCDC uniformly increased the levels of intestinal transcripts encoding all cytokines examined (IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17F, and IFN-\u03b3) compared with the control group, transcripts for IL-10 and IL-17F were further increased in the profilin/QCDC group compared with the profilin only group.

        "text": "Natural killer (NK) cells are sentinel components of the innate response to pathogens, but the cell types, pathogen recognition receptors, and cytokines required for their activation in vivo are poorly defined. Here, we investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), myeloid DCs (mDCs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and of NK cell stimulatory cytokines for the induction of an NK cell response to the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. In vitro, pDCs did not endocytose Leishmania promastigotes but nevertheless released interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta and interleukin (IL)-12 in a TLR9-dependent manner. mDCs rapidly internalized Leishmania and, in the presence of TLR9, produced IL-12, but not IFN-alpha/beta. Depletion of pDCs did not impair the activation of NK cells in L. infantum-infected mice. In contrast, L. infantum-induced NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production were abolished in mDC-depleted mice. The same phenotype was observed in TLR9(-/-) mice, which lacked IL-12 expression by mDCs, and in IL-12(-/-) mice, whereas IFN-alpha/beta receptor(-/-) mice showed only a minor reduction of NK cell IFN-gamma expression. This study provides the first direct evidence that mDCs are essential for eliciting NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma release in vivo and demonstrates that TLR9, mDCs, and IL-12 are functionally linked to the activation of NK cells in visceral leishmaniasis.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND Prolonged-release (PR) fampridine is a potassium channel blocker used as a symptomatic treatment for walking disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Its clinical effects in such patients have not been systematically reviewed, and may be more wide-ranging than expected. OBJECTIVES To summarize the evidence on the effects of PR fampridine in patients with MS. METHODS A systematic search of Pubmed, Scopus (including EMBASE), and PsycINFO (completed in 01/2019) was carried out to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared PR fampridine to placebo. When appropriate, data were pooled using a random-effects model, and standardized mean differences (SMD) were computed. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. PRISMA guidelines were followed. All retrieved functional outcomes were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). RESULTS A total of 706 articles were screened for inclusion. Twenty RCTs involving 2616 patients met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were of good-to-excellent quality. PR fampridine administration resulted in significant benefits in relation to walking short distances (SMD: 1.23 (95% IC 0.65-1.81)) and perceived walking capacity (0.64 (0.27-1.02)). Its effects on muscle strength and middle-distance walking were not significant (0.53 (- 0.04 to 1.10) and 0.31 (- 0.18 to 0.80), respectively). No effect on higher-level cognitive functions (- 0.07 (- 0.58 to 0.45)) or hand and arm use (0.16 (- 0.33 to 0.64)) was observed. Individual studies reported effects on other outcomes across the ICF domains. CONCLUSIONS There is strong evidence that PR fampridine exerts strong effects on the ability to walk short distances and on perceived walking capacity. Other effects of PR fampridine according to the ICF are possible but still unclear.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE Fentanyl sublingual spray, with its rapid onset for pain relief, may be efficacious in the management of acute or post-operative pain. Because patients in these settings may be opioid-na\u00efve, the study was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple dose administration of fentanyl sublingual spray in an opioid-na\u00efve population. METHODS Fentanyl sublingual spray (100 mcg, 200 mcg, and 400 mcg) and fentanyl citrate intravenous (IV; 50 mcg) were administered every 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 h for up to three doses per cohort in opioid-na\u00efve subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02641340). Eight subjects in each cohort were randomly assigned (six subjects received fentanyl sublingual spray; two subjects received fentanyl citrate IV). Pharmacokinetic and safety-related pharmacodynamic assessments were performed through 24 h post-first dose. Safety assessments were collected through Day 7. RESULTS Ninety-six opioid-na\u00efve subjects, aged 20-55 years, with a body mass index of 18.7-31.5 kg/m2, participated in the study. Multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, and 400 mcg) were generally well tolerated. Hypoxia, observed in the 200-mcg and 400-mcg dose groups, increased with increasing doses and higher dosing frequency, but was readily managed by nasal cannula oxygenation. Overall, nausea increased with increasing doses, and \u223c52.6% (10 out of 19) cases of nausea that occurred at the highest dose of 400 mcg were treated with concomitant medication. Overall, the reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of fentanyl.

        "title": "Improving the Compliance of Intraoperative Antibiotic Redosing: A Quality Improvement Initiative",
        "text": "INTRODUCTION: At Children\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the intraoperative antibiotic redosing guidelines and the time frame considered compliant for redosing were unclear. This lack of clarity plus an ill-defined process for ensuring intraoperative antibiotic redosing resulted in a compliance rate of 11%. The organization\u2019s surgical site infection (SSI) rate was 3.19%, above the national benchmark of 1.87%. The primary project goal was to increase intraoperative antibiotic redosing compliance. The secondary project goal was to decrease SSIs. METHODS: With recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America, we developed new organizational redosing guidelines, as well as a new antibiotic-specific reminder alert in the electronic medical record. Implementation of the new guidelines and processes occurred after providing education to the anesthesiologists, surgeons, and circulating nurses. Monthly evaluation of data allowed for quick recognition of oversights followed by the initiation of process updates. RESULTS: Data showed that the initial compliance rate for the intraoperative redosing of antibiotics was 11%. Following interventions, compliance has reached and sustained an average of 99%. Survey results show that provider knowledge of the guidelines and process has improved. Though not directly related, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program observed that the SSI rate decreased from 3.19% in 2014 to 2.3% in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that comprehensive education along with antibiotic-specific electronic medical record alerts significantly increased the compliance of intraoperative antibiotic redosing at Children\u2019s Hospital & Medical Center. Continuous education and monthly updates sustained results for over 40 months.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND While low-grade inflammation has consistently been observed in subjects with depression, studies on the possible relationship between inflammation and other aspects of brain function are as yet sparse. In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between serum levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and personality traits. METHODS In this study, serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP were determined by ELISA in a population of 270 42-year-old women recruited from the population registry who had been assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory. Self-reported previous or ongoing depression was also recorded. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for comparison between two groups and correlations were evaluated by the calculation of Pearson's r-coefficient. RESULTS The temperament trait harm avoidance was positively (r = 0.227, p < 0.05) and the character trait self-directedness was negatively (r = -0.261, p < 0.01) associated with serum levels of CRP (p-values corrected for multiple comparisons). The correlations between the personality traits and CRP were observed also after exclusion of subjects reporting ongoing depression (n = 26). Whereas women reporting ongoing depression showed significantly increased levels of CRP as compared to non-depressed women (n = 155), women reporting a history of depression displayed no significant difference in CRP levels as compared to women that reported that they had never been depressed. CONCLUSION Serum levels of CRP in women was found to be associated with the personality traits harm avoidance and self-directedness. In addition, moderately elevated levels may be a state dependent marker of depression.",

Now, with the continued growing presence of 2009 H1N1 on the global scene, much attention has been focused on the key role of personal protective equipment in healthcare infection control. Much less emphasis has been placed on specific interventions that may minimize the increased infectious risk commonly associated with critical care delivery. Given the frequency of high-risk respiratory procedures such as intubation and delivery of aerosolized medications in the intensive care unit, the delivery of critical care presents unique infection control challenges and unique opportunities to augment usual infection control practice with specific source-control efforts.

While active templates in vitro were able to accumulate in vivo, some very weak templates in vitro were also able to accumulate in vivo without reversion or second-site alterations. Computer models of hairpin structure indicated that biologically active promoters could have hairpins less stable than wild type, with loops of variable length and sequence, and without a need for a 6-base single-stranded tail. In addition, transcripts containing compensatory exchanges in the upper stem region that had limited activity in vitro were biologically active in vivo, indicating that positioning of specific bases in the stem is not required to produce an active minus-strand promoter.",

        "text": "Background The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affecting children and adolescents has increased dramatically in recent years. This increase is most probably related to the obesity pandemic and the high consumption of fructose. However, hepatic steatosis has some rare causes (e.g., some metabolic diseases) of which clinicians should be aware, particularly (but not only) when patients are non-obese or non-overweight. Differential diagnosis is notably important when pathologies have a specific treatment, such as for glycogenosis type IX (GSD-IX). Aims To contribute to the knowledge on the differential diagnosis of NAFLD in paediatric age and to the clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological characterisations of GSD-IX, a rare metabolic disorder. Methods We performed a retrospective study of a small series of cases (n = 3) of GSD-IX diagnosed in the past 6 years, who were currently being followed up in the Units of Gastroenterology or Metabolic Diseases of the Paediatric Division of our hospital and whose clinical presentation was NAFLD in paediatric age. Results Three male patients were diagnosed with NAFLD before 2 years of age, 2 with confirmed diagnosis before the age of 3 years (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], liver ultrasound, and molecular analysis) and 1 whose diagnosis was confirmed at 11 years (ALT, liver ultrasound, liver histology, and molecular analysis). None of the patients were obese or overweight, and the daily fructose consumption was unknown. The outcome was favourable in all 3 patients, with follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 6 years. Conclusion The decision on how far the search for secondary causes of NAFLD should go can be difficult, and GSD-IX must be on the list of possible causes.",

Animal diseases, particularly those caused by new and emerging zoonotic pathogens, must be effectively controlled at their source to reduce their potentially devastating impact upon both animal and human health. As the international organisation responsible for developing standards, guidelines and recommendations for animal health, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) plays an important role in minimising animal and public health risks attributable to zoonoses and other animal diseases, which can have severe consequences for global food safety and security. National Veterinary Services, which implement OIE animal health and welfare standards and other measures, are the first line of defence against these diseases, and must have the capacity to meet the core requirements necessary for their diagnosis and control. The OIE works collaboratively with the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to improve the ability of national animal and public health systems to respond to current and emerging animal health risks with public health consequences. In addition to improving and aligning national laboratory capacities in high-risk areas, the OIE collaborates on One Health-oriented projects for key diseases, establishing model frameworks which can be applied to manage other existing and emerging priority diseases.

However, the association of viral load with clinical characteristics is not well\u2010defined in ALRTI. To explore the correlation between viral load and clinical characteristics of RSV and HMPV in children hospitalized for ALRTI in Lanzhou, China. Three hundred and eighty\u2010seven children hospitalized for ALRTI were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were sampled from each children. Real\u2010time PCR was used to screen RSV, HMPV, and twelve additional respiratory viruses. Bronchiolitis was the leading diagnoses both in RSV and HMPV positive patients. A significantly greater frequency of wheezing (52% vs. 33.52%, P = 0.000) was noted in RSV positive and negative patients. The RSV viral load was significant higher in children aged <1 year (P = 0.003), children without fever and wheezing (P = 0.015 and P = 0.000), days of illness <14 days (P = 0.002), children with bronchiolitis (P = 0.012) and children with RSV single infections (P = 0.000). No difference was found in the clinical features of HMPV positive and negative patients. The HMPV viral load had no correlation with any clinical characteristics. The incidences of severe disease were similar between single infection and coinfection for the two viruses (RSV, P = 0.221; HMPV, P = 0.764) and there has no statistical significance between severity and viral load (P = 0.166 and P = 0.721). Bronchiolitis is the most common disease caused by RSV and HMPV. High viral load or co\u2010infection may be associated with some symptoms but neither has a significant impact on disease severity for the two viruses. J. Med.

        "text": "Current anti-VEGF therapies for colorectal cancer (CRC) provide limited survival benefit, as tumors rapidly develop resistance to these agents. Here, we have uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover, Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2 therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Microbial aetiology of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired pneumonia (ICUAP) determines antibiotic treatment and outcomes. The impact of polymicrobial ICUAP is not extensively known. We therefore investigated the characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial aetiology of ICUAP. METHOD: Patients with ICUAP confirmed microbiologically were prospectively compared according to identification of 1 (monomicrobial) or more (polymicrobial) potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. Microbes usually considered as non-pathogenic were not considered for the etiologic diagnosis. We assessed clinical characteristics, microbiology, inflammatory biomarkers and outcome variables. RESULTS: Among 441 consecutive patients with ICUAP, 256 (58 %) had microbiologic confirmation, and 41 (16 %) of them polymicrobial pneumonia. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and several Enterobacteriaceae were more frequent in polymicrobial pneumonia. Multi-drug and extensive-drug resistance was similarly frequent in both groups. Compared with monomicrobial, patients with polymicrobial pneumonia had less frequently chronic heart disease (6, 15 % vs. 71, 33 %, p = 0.019), and more frequently pleural effusion (18, 50 %, vs. 54, 25 %, p = 0.008), without any other significant difference. Appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment was similarly frequent in the monomicrobial (185, 86 %) and the polymicrobial group (39, 95 %), as were the initial response to the empiric treatment, length of stay and mortality. Systemic inflammatory response was similar comparing monomicrobial with polymicrobial ICUAP. CONCLUSION: The aetiology of ICUAP confirmed microbiologically was polymicrobial in 16 % cases. Pleural effusion and absence of chronic heart disease are associated with polymicrobial pneumonia. When empiric treatment is frequently appropriate, polymicrobial aetiology does not influence the outcome of ICUAP.",

Previous studies report the utility and overall diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL in this vulnerable population, though none focused purely on microbiologic yield or made comparisons with less invasive means of pathogen detection. We sought to determine and elaborate on the microbiologic yield of BAL in SCT recipients, assess a correlation between BAL studies and less invasive means of pathogen detection, and assess the utility of repeating a BAL within 30 days. METHODS: Between January 1, 2009, and July 31, 2013, we reviewed medical records of 125 SCT recipients who underwent 179 BALs. In addition to demographic information and details pertaining to their SCT, a comprehensive review of their microbiologic data was performed and recorded. RESULTS: Our study showed an overall BAL microbiologic yield of 40%, despite 92% of patients receiving broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial therapy at the time of the BAL procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Although an initial BAL sample in this population provides crucial microbiologic information, repeating the procedure within 30 days may have minimal additional microbiologic yield.

Sleep disturbances have been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcomes, such as a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and increasing mortality. Critically ill patients, particularly those receiving mechanical ventilation, may be more susceptible to sleep disruption. METHODS AND RESULTS Mechanical ventilation is an important factor influencing sleep in critically ill patients as it may have positive or negative effects, depending on patient population, mode, and specific settings. Other causes of sleep disruption include the acute illness itself, the daily routine care, and the effects of medications. Improving sleep in patients admitted to an intensive care unit has the potential to improve both short- and long-term clinical outcomes. In this article we review the specific aspects of sleep in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, including abnormal sleep patterns and loss of circadian rhythm, as well as the effects of mechanical ventilation and intravenous sedatives on sleep quality and quantity.

Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6).

Anesthesia management was performed under tertiary medical protection measures. A dedicated anesthesia equipment was separately sterilized. Narcotic drugs were used for one patient only, and disposable medical supplies were used for anesthetic supplies. Contact transmission should be avoided when a neonate required resuscitation, and early isolation and nucleic acid testing were provided for the neonates. The rate of suspected cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was 11% , and the rate of clinically diagnosed cases was 17% before surgery. The rate of clinically diagnosed cases of 2019-nCoV was 22%, the rate of confirmed cases was 8%, and the total positive rate of diagnosis was 31% after surgery. The rate of neuraxial anesthesia was 86%, the rate of general anesthesia was 14%, the time of spinal puncture was (15\u00b17) min, the time of tracheal intubation under general anesthesia was (2.1\u00b11.3) min, the operation time was (95\u00b136) min, and blood loss was (276\u00b1166) ml. The Apgar score of newborns was 8.8 \u00b1 0.5. There was 1 neonate whose mother was diagnosed as having 2019 novel coronavirous disease after operation, an oropharyngeal swab specimen was obtained at 36 h of birth, and the swab was tested positive for 2019-nCoV by nucleic acid testing. As of February 10, 2020, an anesthesiologist involved in the operation was diagnosed to have infection by 2019-nCoV. In conclusion, diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirous disease during pregnancy is more difficult, it is necessary to perform anesthesia management for cesarean section under tertiary medical protection. Although the difficulty in anesthesia operation is increased under tertiary medical protection, anesthesiologists can carry out standardized anesthesia management and guarantee the safety of maternal and infants and anesthesiologists themselves as long as they are rigorously trained and adhere to protective protocols.",

The objective of the study was to investigate the addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) as prebiotic and the combination of Lactobacillus spp. (L), Bacillus spp. (B) as probiotics on productive parameters and economic feasibility. Four hundred male pigs, hybrids of commercial genetic lines (Pietrain), were used: T1 = control group, T2 = 4 kg/tonne SC, T3 = 0.8 kg/tonne feed L and B, T4 = 4 kg/tonne SC + 0.8 kg/tonne L and B. Productive parameters were recorded in the treatment groups for four periods. Then, the viscera of five pigs per treatment were collected after slaughter to evaluate the histological changes and cytokine concentrations in the ileum. The weight gains of groups at 70\u2013100, 100\u2013125 and 125\u2013150 days in the T4 group showed statistically increases (p < .05). Feed intake had a significant difference (p < .05) in T3 versus T1. The feed\u2010conversion ratio improved for all periods in the T4 group (p < .05). The eosinophil, mononuclear infiltration and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 and interleukin\u20106) in the mucosa were lower for treatments with probiotics.

        "title": "The biodistribution of self-assembling protein nanoparticles shows they are promising vaccine platforms",
        "text": "BACKGROUND: Because of the need to limit side-effects, nanoparticles are increasingly being studied as drug-carrying and targeting tools. We have previously reported on a scheme to produce protein-based self-assembling nanoparticles that can act as antigen display platforms. Here we attempted to use the same system for cancer-targeting, making use of a C-terminal bombesin peptide that has high affinity for a receptor known to be overexpressed in certain tumors, as well as an N-terminal polyhistidine tag that can be used for radiolabeling with technetium tricarbonyl. RESULTS: In order to increase circulation time, we experimented with PEGylated and unPEGylated varities typo particle. We also tested the effect of incorporating different numbers of bombesins per nanoparticle. Biophysical characterization determined that all configurations assemble into regular particles with relatively monodisperse size distributions, having peaks of about 33 \u2013 36 nm. The carbonyl method used for labeling produced approximately 80% labeled nanoparticles. In vitro, the nanoparticles showed high binding, both specific and non-specific, to PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, high uptake was observed for all nanoparticle types in the spleens of CD-1 nu/nu mice, decreasing significantly over the course of 24 hours. High uptake was also observed in the liver, while only low uptake was seen in both the pancreas and a tumor xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the nanoparticles are non-specifically taken up by the reticuloendothelial system. Low uptake in the pancreas and tumor indicate that there is little or no specific targeting. PEGylation or increasing the amount of bombesins per nanoparticle did not significantly improve targeting. In particular, the uptake in the spleen, which is a primary organ of the immune system, highlights the potential of the nanoparticles as vaccine carriers. Also, the decrease in liver and spleen radioactivity with time implies that the nanoparticles are broken down and cleared. This is an important finding, as it shows that the nanoparticles can be safely used as a vaccine platform without the risk of prolonged side effects. Furthermore, it demonstrates that technetium carbonyl radiolabeling of our protein-based nanoparticles can be used to evaluate their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo.",

Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death.

        "text": "OBJECTIVES At our institution, custom-made antibiotic-laden cement nails (ACNs) fabricated during surgery using a thoracostomy catheter as a mold are commonly used to treat long-bone infection. As the outer diameter of the nails produced has not previously been described, we designed a study to measure the outer diameter of ACNs fashioned using commercially available and commonly utilized thoracostomy catheters of various sizes. METHODS Six thoracostomy catheters from 2 different manufactures (Argyle PVC Thoracic Catheters; Covidien Ltd and Atrium PVC Thoracic Catheters; Atrium Medical Corporation), ranging from 20 French to 40 French, were utilized in this study. Each catheter was filled with antibiotic-laden cement, and the most proximal segment (largest outer diameter) and most distal segment (smallest outer diameter) were detached for study. Once the cement was cured, the thoracostomy catheters were cut away and the segments were measured using a calibrated digital caliper (Mitutoyo Corp, Aurora, IL). Because the ACNs produced using the technique taper from proximal to distal according to the shape of the thoracostomy catheter design, data were recorded as a maximum and minimum outer diameter for each ACN produced by each of the 6 thoracostomy catheter sizes studied. All measurements were in millimeters and were rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a millimeter. RESULTS The ACNs produced using the various sized thoracostomy catheters had segments with outer diameters ranging from 4.2 mm to 11.2 mm. Both brands of catheters produced nails with similar distal diameters. Specifically, the mean distal diameter measurements were 4.2 mm for a 20 French catheter, 5.5 mm for a 24 French catheter, 6.6 mm for a 28 French catheter, 7.7 mm for a 32 French catheter, 8.4 mm for a 36 French catheter, and 9.9 mm for a 40 French catheter. The Argyle brand catheters produced nails with proximal diameters that increased with the catheter's size, from 7.1 mm for a 20 French catheter to 11.2 mm for a 40 French catheter. The Atrium brand catheters produced nails with a much tighter range of proximal diameters ranging from 9.4 mm to 11.1 mm. CONCLUSIONS Thoracostomy catheters are commonly utilized to produce ACNs. The results of our study confirm that the fabricated nails taper in diameter from proximal to distal. Knowledge of the specific dimensions of the ACN produced by each size thoracostomy catheter will aid the orthopaedic surgeon in selecting the right size based on the diameter of the medullary canal being treated.",

        "text": "Background The world is facing the Coronavirus pandemic which is highly infectious. A number of measures have been put in place to prevent its spread among the population. However, for these preventive measures to be effective, the population requires an appropriate and sufficient knowledge. Thus, a survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of Covid-19 amongst Ugandans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the lockdown in Uganda. An online questionnaire and a snowballing approach was used for participant recruitment of 18 years above literate Ugandans. Data collection was done from 6th to 15th April 2020 during which 1763 people participated. We analyzed all data using STATA 14.2, applying appropriate statistical tests. Results Out of 1763 participants, 97.6% were aware of the current pandemic. 83.9% of participants had a good knowledge score (21.8/27), 72.4% had a good attitude and 85.3% were practicing measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus disease. The ordered logistic regression showed that being a Health worker was significantly associated with a high knowledge (aOR:6 (3.32-10.93); a good attitude (aOR:2.5(1.68-3.8)]) and good practice (aOR:2.9 (1.95-4.2). On contrary, being a driver, business entrepreneur and a security personnel were found to have less rate in awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. Conclusions Ugandans had a good overall awareness, knowledge, attitude and practice. However, there is still a gap of knowledge, attitude and practice among drivers, business entrepreneur and security personnel. There is a need to mobilize the population in the country to have the same degree of awareness and knowledge which will have an impact on attitude and practice to prevent spread of COVID-19.",

        "text": "Prior to 2009, The Netherlands had prepared itself extensively for a potential pandemic. Multidisciplinary guidelines had been drafted to control transmission and limit adverse outcomes for both a phase of early incidental introduction and for a phase with widespread transmission. The Ministry of Health had ensured a supply and distribution schedule for antivirals and negotiated a contract for vaccine purchases. During the pandemic, existing surveillance was expanded, the established infectious disease response structure was activated, and the previously prepared protocols for communication, diagnostics, use of antivirals, and vaccination implementation were operationalized and implemented. When the pandemic turned out to be less severe than many had anticipated, risk communication and rapid modification of guidelines and communication became a major challenge. Antivirals and pandemic vaccines were reserved for those at high risk for severe outcomes only. Overall, the impact of the pandemic was comparable to the impact of an average seasonal influenza epidemic, but with a shift in (severe) outcomes from the very young and elderly toward young adults. Established prepared protocols enabled timely coordinated responses. In preparing for the worst, sufficient attention must be given to preparing for a mild scenario as well.",

The influence of associated treatment in H7N9 infected patients is dramatic and was firstly revealed in species level due to deep sequencing technology. We found that most of the MetaGenomic Species (MGS) enriched in the control samples were Roseburia inulinivorans DSM 16841, butyrate producing bacterium SS3/4 and most of MGS enriched in the H7N9 patients were Clostridium sp. 7 2 43FAA and Enterococcus faecium. It was concluded that H7N9 viral infection and antibiotic administration have a significant effect on the microbiota community with decreased diversity and overgrowth of the bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium.

The construction of these networks is difficult and is mostly done with a static approach, neglecting time delayed interdependences. Tensors are objects that naturally represent multilayer networks and in this paper, we propose a new methodology based on Tucker tensor autoregression in order to build a multilayer network directly from data. This methodology captures within and between connections across layers and makes use of a filtering procedure to extract relevant information and improve visualization. We show the application of this methodology to different stationary fractionally differenced financial data. We argue that our result is useful to understand the dependencies across three different aspects of financial risk, namely market risk, liquidity risk, and volatility risk. Indeed, we show how the resulting visualization is a useful tool for risk managers depicting dependency asymmetries between different risk factors and accounting for delayed cross dependencies.

        "text": "OBJECTIVE It has been hypothesised that the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) might either increase or reduce the risk of severe or lethal COVID-19. The findings from the available observational studies varied, and summary estimates are urgently needed to elucidate whether these drugs should be suspended during the pandemic, or patients and physicians should be definitely reassured. This meta-analysis of adjusted observational data aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the association between these medications and severe/lethal COVID-19. METHODS We searched MedLine, Scopus and preprint repositories up to 8 June 2020 to retrieve cohort or case-control studies comparing the risk of severe/fatal COVID-19 (either mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission or death), among hypertensive subjects treated with: (1) ACE inhibitors, (2) ARBs and (3) both, versus untreated subjects. Data were combined using a random-effect generic inverse variance approach. RESULTS Ten studies, enrolling 9890 hypertensive subjects were included in the analyses. Compared with untreated subjects, those using either ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed a similar risk of severe or lethal COVID-19 (summary OR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26 for ACE inhibitors; 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12 for ARBs). The results did not change when both drugs were considered together, when death was the outcome and excluding the studies with significant, divergent results. CONCLUSION The present meta-analysis strongly supports the recommendation of several scientific societies to continue ARBs or ACE inhibitors for all patients, unless otherwise advised by their physicians who should thus be reassured.",

        "title": "Telehealth Home Support During COVID-19 Confinement for Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild Dementia: Survey Study",
        "text": "BACKGROUND: The public health emergency of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving worldwide; some countries, including Spain, have implemented restrictive measures. Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care and decrease exposure risk. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore the impact of confinement on the health and well-being of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, to provide television-based and telephone-based health and social support, and to study the effects of a television-based assistive integrated technology, TV-AssistDem (TeleVision-based ASSistive Integrated Service to supporT European adults living with mild DEMentia or mild cognitive impairment). METHODS: A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. The mean age was 73.34 (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17/93 respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were performed by family members of 68/93 participants (73%); 57 (61%) reported overall well-being, and 65 (70%) maintained their sleep quality. However, participants living alone reported greater negative feelings and more sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53/93 respondents (57%) took walks, 32 (35%) played memory games, 55 (60%) watched television, and 91 (98%) telephoned relatives. 58/93 (64%) respondents reported accessing moderate or too much COVID-19 information, 89 (97%) received it from television, and 56 (62%) stated that their understanding of the information was extreme. 39/93 (39%) respondents had contacted health and social services, while 29 (31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. There were no significant differences in health and well-being between the intervention and control groups. Respondents with TV-AssistDem performed more memory exercises (24/93, 52% vs 8/93, 17.4%; P<.001) than control respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that during COVID-19 confinement, the physical and mental health and well-being was optimal for the majority of our vulnerable population. However, those living alone reported greater negative psychological effects and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to address the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technology. Television sets were preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity. Television-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem demonstrated potential for cognitive stimulation.

RESULTS Of 4060 patients with fever 275 cases were admitted to the isolated ward, 145 cases were diagnosed as SARS (3.75 percent), 29 belonged to suspected cases, and in 101 cases SARS was ruled out. Ninety-three cases were non-SARS-pneumonia, 2 were epidemic encephalitis, 8 were epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, and 3 cases were epidemic hemorrhagic fever. CONCLUSION During epidemic of SARS, the etiology of fever is influenza or other virus infection in 90 percent of patients. Non-SARS-pneumonia and infectious diseases with fever accounted for certain proportion of patients with fever. Our diagnostic level should be improved.

Using as input the infection fatality rate and the interval between infection and death, the number of infections in Mumbai is inferred. It is found that the ratio of the number of test positives to the total infections is 0.13\\% (median), implying that tests are currently finding 1 out of 750 cases of infection.

        "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak has fueled a global demand for effective diagnosis and treatment as well as mitigation of the spread of infection, all through large-scale approaches such as specific alternative antiviral methods and classical disinfection protocols. Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of \"nanoimmunity by design\" can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when preparing for future pandemics.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND The spectrum of acute symptoms in young outpatient children with respiratory tract infection (RTI) is variable, and it cannot be explained by the diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM) versus uncomplicated RTI. We studied that the variation of symptoms is explained by the nasopharyngeal bacteria and/or respiratory viruses. METHODS Children aged 6-35 months with acute symptoms with AOM (n = 201) or without AOM (n = 225) were eligible in this cross-sectional study. We analyzed their nasopharyngeal samples for pathogenic bacteria by culture and for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We surveyed 17 symptoms (fever, respiratory, ear related, nonspecific, gastrointestinal) with a structured questionnaire. RESULTS Fever had a positive association with influenza viruses [odds ratio (OR): 6.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-26.27], human metapneumovirus (OR: 3.84; 95% CI: 1.25-11.77), coronaviruses (OR: 3.45; 95% CI: 1.53-7.75) and parainfluenza viruses (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.07-4.47). Rhinitis (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: 1.93-13.36), nasal congestion (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.25-3.31) and cough (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.15-3.17) had positive associations with Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, cough had a positive association with respiratory syncytial virus (OR: 7.20; 95% CI: 1.59-32.71) and parainfluenza viruses (OR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.02-7.69). CONCLUSIONS The variation of acute symptoms in young children may be influenced by both nasopharyngeal bacteria and respiratory viruses. Our results showed a strong association between fever and respiratory viruses; rhinitis, nasal congestion and cough were associated with M. catarrhalis in the presence of viruses.

Mean COx was calculated for each patient for each postnatal day. The percentage of time with impaired autoregulation (COx>0.5) was also calculated. RESULTS FGR neonates had higher mean COx values than their AGA peers on day 2 (0.15 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.18) vs 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.13), p=0.029) and day 3 (0.17 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.20) vs 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.12), p=0.003) of life. FGR neonates spent more time with impaired autoregulation (COx value >0.5) than controls on postnatal day 2 (19% (95% CI 16% to 22%) vs 14% (95% CI 12% to 17%), p=0.035) and day 3 (20% (95% CI 17% to 24%) vs 15% (95% CI 12% to 18%), p=0.016). CONCLUSION FGR preterm neonates more frequently display impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation compared with AGA peers on days 2 and 3 of life which may predispose them to brain injury. Further studies are required to investigate whether this impairment persists beyond the first few days of life and whether this impairment is linked to poor neurodevelopmental outcome.",

        "text": "IL-1\u03b2 has emerged as a key mediator of the cytokine storm linked to high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and blockade of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) with Anakinra has entered clinical trials in COVID-19 subjects. Yet, knowledge of the specific immune cell subsets targeted by IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling pathways in humans is limited. Utilizing mass cytometry (CyTOF) of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 T cells and CD4\u2212CD8low/-CD161+ T cells as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest expression of p-NF-\u03baB in response to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Notably, CCR6 distinctly identified T cells most responsive to IL-1\u03b2. Other subsets including CD11c myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), classical monocytes (CM), two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16\u2212CD56brightCD161\u2212 and CD16\u2212CD56dimCD161+) and a population of lineage\u2212(Lin-) cells expressing CD161 and CD25 also showed IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB. The IL-1R antagonist, Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced p-NF-kB in the CCR6+ T cells and CD11c mDCs with a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin\u2212CD161+CD25+ cells. IL-1\u03b2 also induced a rapid but much less robust increase in p-p38 expression as compared to p-NF-kB in the majority of these same immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1\u03b2 stimulation greatly increased p-STAT3 and to a much lesser extent p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 in T cell subsets, monocytes, DCs and the Lin\u2212CD161+CD25+ cells suggesting IL-1\u03b2-induced production of downstream STAT-activating cytokines, consistent with its role in cytokine storm. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of this activation by Anakinra raises the intriguing possibility that assays to measure IL-1\u03b2-induced p-NF-kB in CCR6+ T cell subtypes could identify those at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from Anakinra therapy.",

However, such structures lack moisture permeability and breathability leading to an uncomfortable, stuffy wearing experience. Here, we propose a novel medical protective clothing material with a superabsorbent layer to enhance moisture absorption. Poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)/polyvinyl alcohol superabsorbent fibers (PAAAM/PVA fibers) were prepared via wet spinning. And the superabsorbent composite layer was stacked from PAAAM/PVA fibers, bamboo pulp fibers (BPF) and ethylene-propylene side by side fibers (ESF). The novel disposable medical protective composite fabric was obtained through gluing the superabsorbent layer to the inner surface of strong antistatic polypropylene nonwoven fabric. The resultant composite fabric possesses excellent absorption and retention capacity for sweat, up to 12.3 g/g and 63.8%, and a maximum hygroscopic rate of 1.04 g/h, higher than that of the conventional material (only 0.53 g/h). The moisture permeability of the novel material reached 12,638.5 g/(m(2) d), which was 307.6% of the conventional material.

        "text": "Abstract Bcr-Abl is a dysregulated tyrosine kinase whose mechanism of activation is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that, like c-Abl, Bcr-Abl is negatively regulated through its SH3 domain. Kinase activity, transformation, and leukemogenesis by Bcr-Abl are greatly impaired by mutations of the Bcr coiled-coil domain that disrupt oligomerization, but restored by an SH3 point mutation that blocks ligand binding or a complementary mutation at the intramolecular SH3 binding site defined in c-Abl. Phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop of the catalytic domain and the linker between the SH2 and catalytic domains (SH2-CD linker) is dependent on oligomerization and required for leukemogenesis. These results suggest that Bcr-Abl has a monomeric, unphosphorylated state with the SH3 domain engaged intramolecularly to Pro1124 in the SH2-CD linker, the form that is sensitive to the inhibitor imatinib (STI-571). The sole function of the coiled-coil domain is to disrupt the autoinhibited conformation through oligomerization and intermolecular autophosphorylation.",

        "text": "Objective We compared the clinical characteristics, findings and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or influenza to detect relevant differences. Methods From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at the HUS Jorvi Hospital, Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for at least 30 days from admission. Results We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs 15 [45%], P=0.03 and 1 [4%] vs 10 [30%], P=0.008). In chest x-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], P < 0.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs 19 [58%], P=0.003 and 8 [29%] vs 2 [6%], P=0.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (6 days [IQR 4-21] vs 3 [2-4], P<0.001). Conclusion Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.",

Although an increased likelihood of significant brain lesions with age has been identified in neurologically normal dogs with epileptic seizures, the underlying aetiology of epileptic seizures in cats that present with normal physical and neurological examinations remains unknown. In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined MRI findings in a large population of cats with a normal interictal physical and neurological examination. They hypothesised that age would have an impact on the prevalence of detectable lesions. First, following the guidelines for dogs and in accordance with previous studies, the authors divided the cats into three age groups (aged one year or younger, between one and six, and older than six) and calculated the proportion of cats with a detectable lesion on MRI in these groups. In the first group, 3/32 cats (9.4 per cent) had significant MRI abnormalities that were all consistent with congenital malformation; in the second group, only 5/92 (5.4 per cent) MRI scans were abnormal and in the third group, 15/ 65 (23.1 per cent) cats showed abnormal findings that were predominantly lesions of neoplastic origin. Second, to investigate the impact of age further, data were investigated as a continuous variable using receiver operating characteristic analysis. This indicated an optimal cut-off age of five years, above which MRI abnormalities were more likely, with an increase in the odds of a significant structural lesion increasing by 14 per cent per year.",

        "text": "The protection level offered by filtering facepiece particulate respirators and face masks is defined by the percentage of ambient particles penetrating inside the protection device. There are two penetration pathways: (1) through the faceseal leakage, and the (2) filter medium. This study aimed at differentiating the contributions of these two pathways for particles in the size range of 0.03\u20131 \u03bcm under actual breathing conditions. One N95 filtering facepiece respirator and one surgical mask commonly used in health care environments were tested on 25 subjects (matching the latest National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fit testing panel) as the subjects performed conventional fit test exercises. The respirator and the mask were also tested with breathing manikins that precisely mimicked the prerecorded breathing patterns of the tested subjects. The penetration data obtained in the human subject- and manikin-based tests were compared for different particle sizes and breathing patterns. Overall, 5250 particle size- and exercise-specific penetration values were determined. For each value, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio was calculated to quantify the relative contributions of the two penetration pathways. The number of particles penetrating through the faceseal leakage of the tested respirator/mask far exceeded the number of those penetrating through the filter medium. For the N95 respirator, the excess was (on average) by an order of magnitude and significantly increased with an increase in particle size (p < 0.001): \u223c7-fold greater for 0.04 \u03bcm, \u223c10-fold for 0.1 \u03bcm, and \u223c20-fold for 1 \u03bcm. For the surgical mask, the faceseal leakage-to-filter ratio ranged from 4.8 to 5.8 and was not significantly affected by the particle size for the tested submicrometer fraction. Facial/body movement had a pronounced effect on the relative contribution of the two penetration pathways. Breathing intensity and facial dimensions showed some (although limited) influence. Because most of the penetrated particles entered through the faceseal, the priority in respirator/mask development should be shifted from improving the efficiency of the filter medium to establishing a better fit that would eliminate or minimize faceseal leakage.",

Our methods allow for the measurement of the strength of lymphatic contraction of an individual lymphangion in a mouse, which has not yet been demonstrated using other published methods. The ability to study murine collecting lymphatic vessel contraction-using the methods described here or other recently published techniques-allows the field to dissect the molecular mechanisms controlling lymphatic pumping under normal and pathological conditions using the wide variety of molecular tools and genetic models available in the mouse.

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Synthetic virology is an important multidisciplinary scientific field, with emerging applications in biotechnology and medicine, aiming at developing methods to generate and engineer synthetic viruses. In particular, many of the RNA viruses, including among others the Dengue and Zika, are widespread pathogens of significant importance to human health. The ability to design and synthesize such viruses may contribute to exploring novel approaches for developing vaccines and virus based therapies. RESULTS: Here we develop a full multidisciplinary pipeline for generation and analysis of synthetic RNA viruses and specifically apply it to Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The major steps of the pipeline include comparative genomics of endogenous and synthetic viral strains. Specifically, we show that although the synthetic DENV-2 viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, is similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype master strain. Additionally, the highly variable positions, identified in the analyzed DENV-2 population, were found to overlap with less conserved homologous positions in Zika virus and other Dengue serotypes. These results may suggest that synthetic DENV-2 could enhance virulence if the correct sequence is selected. CONCLUSIONS: The approach reported in this study can be used to generate and analyze synthetic RNA viruses both on genotypic and on phenotypic level. It could be applied for understanding the functionality and the fitness effects of any set of mutations in viral RNA and for editing RNA viruses for various target applications.

        "text": "INTRODUCTION Conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard surgical treatment for symptomatic gallstones. Surgeons have attempted to minimize the number of incisions via single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC), which offers benefits including improved cosmesis, possibly less postoperative pain, and improved patient satisfaction. However, studies show that there is an increased risk of operative complications-in particular bile duct injuries. We report 500 consecutive cases of SILC performed without bile duct injury. METHODS A retrospective study of 500 continuous cases of SILC performed by the same surgeon at a single institution was conducted. Data on patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. Detailed analysis of surgical techniques specifically to reduce bile duct injury was performed and described in this study. RESULTS In total, 500 patients underwent SILC during the study period. Eight patients needed additional ports to complete the surgery, while one was converted to an open surgery. No serious intraoperative complications, such as bile duct injury, were encountered. CONCLUSION Our experience shows that with due care and caution during SILC, with particular attention towards achieving the critical view of safety and a standardized technique, bile duct injury in SILC can be avoided.",

Specifically, the study was designed to investigate the influence of MIC on the activity of prolonged-infusion TZP using pharmacokinetics (PKs) consistent with a non-critically ill patient population. There was no benefit with prolonged- compared with standard-infusion TZP against isolates with susceptible MICs of 8 or 16 mg/L. However, prolonged-infusion TZP produced more than two times the final bacterial kill against less susceptible isolates with an intermediate MIC of 32 mg/L. The PDs of TZP were well described by a sigmoid Emax model (r(2) = 0.84) where %\u0192T>MIC thresholds of 27 and 75% were associated with bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, respectively. However, the well-established PD relationship with %\u0192T>MIC was not observed with prolonged-infusion TZP.

The aim of this study was to determine the adenovirus (AdV) types isolated from clinical specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. A total of 22 AdV strains isolated between January 1st 2011 to May 31th 2011, from various samples (295 nasopharyngeal swabs, 42 conjunctival swabs, 13 stool) sent to our routine virology laboratory were included in the study. Of the 22 patients whose samples yielded adenovirus positivity, 8 were adult (4 were male; median age: 32.5 years) and 14 (7 were male; median age: 1 year) were children. Those specimens (14 nasopharyngeal swabs, 7 conjunctival swabs, 1 stool) were obtained from patients with URTIs (n= 6), LRTIs (n= 8), conjunctivitis (n= 7) and gastroenteritis (n= 1). For the isolation and identification of adenoviruses, rapid (shell vial) cell culture and direct immunofluorescence antibody methods were used, respectively. Molecular typing of adenoviruses were performed by PCR and sequencing of a partial region (hipervariable region 1-6) of the hexon gene. PCR primers (Adhex F1, Adhex R1) used for DNA amplification were from those described by Lu and Erdman, previously. If insufficient DNA was amplified from the first reaction for sequencing, a nested PCR was performed using Adhex F2 and Adhex R2 primers. Sequencing was performed using the amplification primers and Sequence Reagent Mix-DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc, USA) on ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Obtained adenovirus sequences were typed by BLAST analysis and three AdV types namely type 3, 4, and 8 were identified. In our study, AdV type 3 was detected in a gastroenteritis case and six cases with URTIs and LRTIs (n= 7, 31.8%). AdV type 8 was identified as the cause of conjunctivitis in seven patients and of URTIs and LRTIs in five patients (n= 12, 54.5%). AdV type 4 was found to be associated with URTI in one, and LRTIs in two patients (n= 3; 13.7%). Our data indicated that AdV type 8 was the most prevalent type in patients with conjunctivitis and URTIs, while AdV type 3 was the most prevalent type in patients with LRTI. BLAST analysis was thought to be useful for the molecular typing of adenoviruses.

        "text": "The role of endovascular procedures in the treatment of acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) is expanding. For treatment, the choice between surgical or endovascular is still debated. The aim of this study was to identify factors that determine the selection of treatment. This study included 307 ALI patients (209 with thrombosis). Patient details, factors affecting the procedure choice, and outcomes were analyzed. The majority of patients were operated on (52.4%). Surgery was more frequent in embolic patients with embolus (odds ratio (OR) 33.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.22-184.19, p < 0.0001), severe ischemia (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.2-2.66, p = 0.0041), and active cancer (OR 4.99; 95% CI 1.26-19.72, p = 0.02). Tibial arteries involvement was negatively related to surgery (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.06-0.95, p = 0.04). The complications and amputation rates were comparable. Reinterventions were more common in the endovascular group (19 (20.2%) vs. 17 (8.9%), p = 0.007). The six-month mortality was higher in the operated patients (12.6% vs. 3.2%, respectively, p = 0.001). The determinants of the treatment path are ischemia severity, concurrent cancer, embolus, and peripheral lesion location. Modification of the Rutherford acute lower limb ischemia classification is required to improve the decision-making in patients with profound ischemia.",

        "title": "Changing risk awareness and personal protection measures for low to high pathogenic avian influenza in live-poultry markets in Taiwan, 2007 to 2012",
        "text": "BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of low and high pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI, HPAI) H5N2 in chickens have occurred in Taiwan since 2003 and 2012, respectively. Fully understanding the different awareness, attitudes and protective behaviors adopted by workers in live-poultry markets (LPMWs) and local community residents (CRs) to face the challenges of LPAI and HPAI is very important to minimize viral adaptations to human populations. METHODS: A structural questionnaire containing information on respondents\u2019 occupation, personal risk awareness, attitudes toward different policies, and preventative measures was administered. The two-stage survey (before and after HPAI H5N2 outbreaks) was conducted from 2007 to 2012, including: (1) 430 LPMWs and 418 CRs at LPMs from different geographical areas of Taiwan after the government announced outbreaks of LPAI H5N2 during 2007\u20132009, and (2) 73 LPMWs and 152 CRs at two LPMs in central Taiwan after the HPAI H5N2 outbreaks in 2012. The chi-squared test and logistic regression were applied for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. RESULTS: Before HPAI-H5N2 outbreaks, higher educated respondents demonstrated greater risk awareness and concerns regarding AI. However, LPM-workers protected themselves less from AI viruses (AIVs) and had lower acceptance of human or avian influenza vaccines. Most importantly, the participants who opposed (versus agreed with) the policy on banning live-poultry slaughtering at LPMs reported lower awareness of government prevention and control policies [Odds Ratio (OR): 0.76, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 0.56\u20131.01] or practiced preventive measures (OR: 0.42, 95 % CI: 0.25\u20130.70). After HPAI-H5N2 outbreaks, the risk awareness about AI in central Taiwan significantly increased [LPAI to HPAI LPMWs: 34.6 to 65.6 %, p < 0.05; CRs: 44.0 to 76.5 %, p < 0.05] and LPMWs\u2019 belief in the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent human or avian influenza virus infection strikingly decreased (92.3 to 68.5 %, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Risk awareness depends on high or low pathogenicity of AIVs, working in LPMs, levels of education, age, and proximity to the sites of severe AI outbreaks. Regardless of novel LPAI or HPAI virus reassortants that pose public health risks, prompt and clear risk communication focusing on both correct information about AIVs and the most appropriate preventive measures are important for effective prevention of human infection.

        "text": "The positive-strand coronavirus genome of ~30 kilobase in length and subgenomic (sg) mRNAs of shorter lengths, are 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-co-terminal by virtue of a common 5\u2019-capped leader and a common 3\u2019-polyadenylated untranslated region. Here, by ligating head-to-tail viral RNAs from bovine coronavirus-infected cells and sequencing across the ligated junctions, it was learned that at the time of peak viral RNA synthesis [6 hours postinfection (hpi)] the 3\u2019 poly(A) tail on genomic and sgmRNAs is ~65 nucleotides (nt) in length. Surprisingly, this length was found to vary throughout infection from ~45 nt immediately after virus entry (at 0 to 4 hpi) to ~65 nt later on (at 6 h to 9 hpi) and from ~65 nt (at 6 h to 9 hpi) to ~30 nt (at 120-144 hpi). With the same method, poly(U) sequences of the same lengths were simultaneously found on the ligated viral negative-strand RNAs. Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus can present with atypical signs and symptoms such as those of acute kidney injury, gastroenteritis, pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have also been reported, particularly in severe cases with multisystem involvement. Scrub typhus has never been reported in the literature to cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) which includes cystitis and pyelonephritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient\u2019s hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus\u2014IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient\u2019s symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.",

        "text": "Abstract Aluminum alloys are significant in various applications, and the desire is strong to develop higher strength with balanced other properties out of high Zn and Mg contents in aluminum. However, high contents of Zn and Mg will make the matrix brittle and incompatible for mass manufacturing. As nanoparticles could effectively and dynamically control the brittle secondary phases, it opens a new route to design and manufacture high-Zn and high-Mg aluminum alloys. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of nanomanufacturing of Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy system with the help from TiC nanoparticles for potential ultrahigh-strength light-weight alloys. By applying the \u201chot rolling-natural aging\u201d and \u201csolution treatment-natural aging\u201d processing routes, Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy with TiC nanoparticles can achieve higher microhardness via natural aging and better machinability when compared with the pure Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy. Microstructure and thermodynamic studies reveal that the reasons for the peak hardness difference of Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy and Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu/1.5 vol.% TiC nanocomposites are due to the free energy difference by solution treatment temperature and the strain energy sustained by the residual secondary phases. The enhanced mechanical properties in Al-12Zn-3.7Mg-1Cu alloy with TiC nanoparticles at the peak-microhardness state after \u201csolution treatment-natural aging\u201d processing route prove the feasibility of the abovementioned nano-treating manufacturing method.",

        "text": "PURPOSE Sterilization via bilateral total salpingectomy is slowly replacing partial salpingectomy, as it is believed to decrease the incidence of ovarian cancer. Our objective was to compare short-term intra and post-operative complication rates of bilateral total salpingectomy versus partial salpingectomy performed during the course of a cesarean delivery. METHODS A large series of tubal sterilizations during cesarean sections were studied in a single tertiary medical center between 1/2014 and 8/2016 before and after a policy change was made, switching from partial salpingectomy to total salpingectomy. Patients who underwent bilateral partial salpingectomy using the modified Pomeroy technique were compared with those who underwent total salpingectomy. Operative length, estimated blood loss, postpartum fever, wound infection, need for re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, and blood transfusions were compared. RESULTS During the study period, 149 women met inclusion criteria. Fifty parturients underwent bilateral total salpingectomy and 99 underwent partial salpingectomy in the course of the cesarean section. Demographic, obstetrical, and surgical characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean cesarean section duration was comparable for partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy (a median of 35 min in both groups, P = 0.92). Complications were rare in both groups with no significant differences in rates of postpartum fever, wound infection, re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, estimated blood loss, transfusions, and readmissions within 1-month postpartum. CONCLUSION Rates of short-term complications are similar in patients undergoing bilateral partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy during cesarean deliveries, making the latter a feasible alternative to the former.",

        "text": "The initial step in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA replication is the synthesis of negative-strand RNA from a positive-strand genomic RNA template. Our approach to begin studying MHV RNA replication is to identify the cis-acting signals for RNA synthesis and the proteins which recognize these signals at the 3' end of genomic RNA of MHV. To determine whether host cellular and/or viral proteins interact with the 3' end of the coronavirus genome, an RNase T1 protection/gel mobility shift electrophoresis assay was used to examine cytoplasmic extracts from mock- and MHV-JHM-infected 17Cl-1 murine cells for the ability to form complexes with defined regions of the genomic RNA. We demonstrated the specific binding of host cell proteins to multiple sites within the 3' end of MHV-JHM genomic RNA. By using a set of RNA probes with deletions at either the 5' or 3' end or both ends, two distinct binding sites were located. The first protein-binding element was mapped in the 3'-most 42 nucleotides of the genomic RNA [3' (+42) RNA], and the second element was mapped within an 86-nucleotide sequence encompassing nucleotides 171 to 85 from the 3' end of the genome (171-85 RNA). A single potential stem-loop structure is predicted for the 3' (+)42 RNA, and two stem-loop structures are predicted for the 171-85 RNA. Proteins interacting with these two elements were identified by UV-induced covalent cross-linking to labeled RNAs followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The RNA-protein complex formed with the 3'-most 42 nucleotides contains approximately five host polypeptides, a highly labeled protein of 120 kDa and four minor species with sizes of 103, 81, 70, and 55 kDa. The second protein-binding element, contained within a probe representing nucleotides 487 to 85 from the 3' end of the genome, also appears to bind five host polypeptides, 142, 120, 100, 55, and 33 kDa in size, with the 120-kDa protein being the most abundant. The RNA-protein complexes observed with MHV-infected cells in both RNase protection/gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays were identical to those observed with uninfected cells.

        "title": "Lung-ultrasound objective structured assessment of technical skills (LUS-OSAUS): utility in the assessment of lung-ultrasound trained medical undergraduates",
        "text": "PURPOSE: Recently, some attempts have been made to integrate lung ultrasound (LUS) teaching into medical curricula. However, current education studies of LUS are extremely heterogeneous due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines on LUS education. In particular, the assessment of competencies is poorly standardized and mostly relies on non-validated scales. A new validated tool, the objective structured assessment of lung ultrasound skills (LUS-OSAUS), has the potential to overcome these limitations. Therefore, we adopted the LUS-OSAUS tool to assess the competencies of a group of LUS-trained undergraduates. Existing no prior practical applications of the LUS-OSAUS, our aim was to investigate the practical utility of this tool and its applicability in the evaluation of US-trained medical students. METHODS: Eight undergraduates (two males, six females) were enrolled on a voluntary basis to receive a theoretical and practical training in LUS. Once completed their training, each student performed an LUS examination on a different patient hospitalized for respiratory symptoms. The same eight patients were also scanned by a senior resident in emergency medicine for a comparison with students\u2019 results. Students and the senior resident were tested by an examiner using the LUS-OSAUS tool. We compared the scores obtained by operators in all areas of competence of the LUS-OSAUS, the total scores, and the time needed to complete the sonographic task. RESULTS: Median students\u2019 score in the single items of the scale was significantly lower than the ones obtained by the senior resident (4.0 [3.3\u20135.0] vs. 5.0 [5.0\u20135.0]; p < 0.0001). Students scored significantly lower than the senior resident in each item, except for B-line identification, choice of the correct transducer, and suggested focused questions. Median total score was also lower for students compared to the senior resident (70.5 [61.0\u201374.8] vs. 84.0 [83.5\u201384.3] (p = 0.0116). Median time required to complete the examination was significantly higher for students (14.1 [12.8\u201316.1] vs. 4.7 [3.9\u20135.2] min, p = 0.0117). CONCLUSIONS: The LUS-OSAUS tool allowed for a standardized and comprehensive assessment of student\u2019s competencies in lung ultrasound, and helped to discriminate their level of expertise from that of a more experienced operator. The scale also specifically tests the theoretical knowledge of trainees, thus making redundant the use of questionnaires designed for this purpose.

        "title": "Pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding.",
        "text": "BACKGROUND Platelet transfusions are used to prevent and treat bleeding in patients who are thrombocytopenic. Despite improvements in donor screening and laboratory testing, a small risk of viral, bacterial or protozoal contamination of platelets remains. There is also an ongoing risk from newly emerging blood transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) for which laboratory tests may not be available at the time of initial outbreak.One solution to reduce further the risk of TTIs from platelet transfusion is photochemical pathogen reduction, a process by which pathogens are either inactivated or significantly depleted in number, thereby reducing the chance of transmission. This process might offer additional benefits, including platelet shelf-life extension, and negate the requirement for gamma-irradiation of platelets. Although current pathogen-reduction technologies have been proven significantly to reduce pathogen load in platelet concentrates, a number of published clinical studies have raised concerns about the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for post-transfusion platelet recovery and the prevention of bleeding when compared with standard platelets. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelets for the prevention of bleeding in patients requiring platelet transfusions. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to 18 February 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 18 February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to 18 February 2013) and the Transfusion Evidence Library (1980 to 18 February 2013). We also searched several international and ongoing trial databases and citation-tracked relevant reference lists. We requested information on possible unpublished trials from known investigators in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the transfusion of pathogen-reduced platelets with standard platelets. We did not identify any RCTs which compared the transfusion of one type of pathogen-reduced platelets with another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author screened all references, excluding duplicates and those clearly irrelevant. Two authors then screened the remaining references, confirmed eligibility, extracted data and analysed trial quality independently. We requested and obtained a significant amount of missing data from trial authors. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate using the fixed-effect model for risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and used the I\u00b2 statistic to explore heterogeneity, employing the random-effects model when I\u00b2 was greater than 30%. MAIN RESULTS We included 10 trials comparing pathogen-reduced platelets with standard platelets. Nine trials assessed Intercept\u00ae pathogen-reduced platelets and one trial Mirasol\u00ae pathogen-reduced platelets. Two were randomised cross-over trials and the remaining eight were parallel-group RCTs. In total, 1422 participants were available for analysis across the 10 trials, of which 675 participants received Intercept\u00ae and 56 Mirasol\u00ae platelet transfusions. Four trials assessed the response to a single study platelet transfusion (all Intercept\u00ae) and six to multiple study transfusions (Intercept\u00ae (N = 5), Mirasol\u00ae (N = 1)) compared with standard platelets.We found the trials to be generally at low risk of bias but heterogeneous regarding the nature of the interventions (platelet preparation), protocols for platelet transfusion, definitions of outcomes, methods of outcome assessment and duration of follow-up.Our primary outcomes were mortality, 'any bleeding', 'clinically significant bleeding' and 'severe bleeding', and were grouped by duration of follow-up: short (up to 48 hours), medium (48 hours to seven days) or long (more than seven days). Meta-analysis of data from five trials of multiple platelet transfusions reporting 'any bleeding' over a long follow-up period found an increase in bleeding in those receiving pathogen-reduced platelets compared with standard platelets using the fixed-effect model (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, I\u00b2 = 59%); however, this meta-analysis showed no difference between treatment arms when using the random-effects model (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38).There was no evidence of a difference between treatment arms in the number of patients with 'clinically significant bleeding' (reported by four out of the same five trials) or 'severe bleeding' (reported by all five trials) (respectively, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21, I\u00b2 = 2%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.12, I\u00b2 = 51%). We also found no evidence of a difference between treatment arms for all-cause mortality, acute transfusion reactions, adverse events, serious adverse events and red cell transfusion requirements in the trials which reported on these outcomes. No bacterial transfusion-transmitted infections occurred in the six trials that reported this outcome.Although the definition of platelet refractoriness differed between trials, the relative risk of this event was 2.74 higher following pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion (RR 2.74, 95% CI 1.84 to 4.07, I\u00b2 = 0%). Participants required 7% more platelet transfusions following pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion when compared with standard platelet transfusion (MD 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, I\u00b2 = 21%), although the interval between platelet transfusions was only shown to be significantly shorter following multiple Intercept\u00ae pathogen-reduced platelet transfusion when compared with standard platelet transfusion (MD -0.51, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.37, I\u00b2 = 0%). In trials of multiple pathogen-reduced platelets, our analyses showed the one- and 24-hour count and corrected count increments to be significantly inferior to standard platelets. However, one-hour increments were similar in trials of single platelet transfusions, although the 24-hour count and corrected count increments were again significantly lower. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a difference in mortality, 'clinically significant' or 'severe bleeding', transfusion reactions or adverse events between pathogen-reduced and standard platelets. For a range of laboratory outcomes the results indicated evidence of some benefits for standard platelets over pathogen-reduced platelets. These conclusions are based on data from 1422 patients included in 10 trials. Results from ongoing or new trials are required to determine if there are clinically important differences in bleeding risk between pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions and standard platelet transfusions. Given the variability in trial design, bleeding assessment and quality of outcome reporting, it is recommended that future trials apply standardised approaches to outcome assessment and follow-up, including safety reporting.",

        "text": "Facemasks are recommended for diseases transmitted through droplets and respirators for respiratory aerosols, yet recommendations and terminology vary between guidelines. The concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice have recently been shown to be more complex than previously thought. Several randomised clinical trials of facemasks have been conducted in community and healthcare settings, using widely varying interventions, including mixed interventions (such as masks and handwashing), and diverse outcomes. Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance. Two trials in healthcare workers favoured respirators for clinical respiratory illness. The use of reusable cloth masks is widespread globally, particularly in Asia, which is an important region for emerging infections, but there is no clinical research to inform their use and most policies offer no guidance on them. Health economic analyses of facemasks are scarce and the few published cost effectiveness models do not use clinical efficacy data. The lack of research on facemasks and respirators is reflected in varied and sometimes conflicting policies and guidelines. Further research should focus on examining the efficacy of facemasks against specific infectious threats such as influenza and tuberculosis, assessing the efficacy of cloth masks, investigating common practices such as reuse of masks, assessing compliance, filling in policy gaps, and obtaining cost effectiveness data using clinical efficacy estimates.",

SARS-CoV from human has shown some variations but its origin is still unknown. The genotyping and phylogeny of SARS-CoV were analyzed and reported in this paper. METHODS Full or partial genomes of 44 SARS-CoV strains were collected from GenBank. The genotype, single nucleotide polymorphism and phylogeny of these SARS-CoV strains were analyzed by molecular biological, bioinformatic and epidemiological methods. RESULTS There were 188 point mutations in the 33 virus full genomes with the counts of mutation mounting to 297. Further analysis was carried out among 36 of 188 loci with more than two times of mutation. All the 36 mutation loci occurred in coding sequences and 22 loci were non-synonymous. The gene mutation rates of replicase 1AB, S2 domain of spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein were lower (0.079% - 0.103%). There were 4 mutation loci in S1 domain of spike glycoprotein. The gene mutation rate of ORF10 was the highest (3.333%) with 4 mutation loci in this small domain (120 bp) and 3 of 4 loci related to deletion mutation. By bioinformatics processing and analysis, the nucleotides at 7 loci of genome (T:T:A:G:T:C:T/C:G:G:A:C:T:C) can classify SARS-CoV into two types. Therefore a novel definition is put forward that according to these 7 loci of mutation, 40 strains of SARS-CoV in GenBank can be grouped into two genotypes, T:T:A:G:T:C:T and C:G:G:A:C:T:C, and named as SARS-CoV Yexin genotype and Xiaohong genotype. The two genotypes can be further divided into some sub-genotypes. These genotypes can also be approved by phylogenetic tree of three levels of 44 loci of mutation, spike glycoprotein gene and complete genome sequence. Compared to various strains among SARS-CoV Yexin genotype and Xiaohong genotype, GD01 strain of Yexin genotype is more closely related to SARS-CoV like-virus from animals. CONCLUSION The results mentioned above suggest that SARS-CoV is responding to host immunological pressures and experiencing variation which provide clues, information and evidence of molecular biology for the clinical pathology, vaccine developing and epidemic investigation.",

The aim was to determine whether new-onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres. Consecutive patients positive for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups. New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77-165.4, P = 0.003)]. COVID-19 patients with new-onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID-19 patients without STDs (52.6 \u00b1 17.2 vs. 67.4 \u00b1 15.1, P < 0.001). Amongst COVID-19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction. The mean duration of STD was 7.5 \u00b1 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 \u00b1 2.3 days of onset. CONCLUSION: New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients; they usually had an acute onset and were commonly an initial manifestation. The use of STD assessment in anamnesis as a hint for COVID-19 and to support individuals' self-isolation in the current epidemic context is suggested.",

This paper was endorsed by the Stroke Unit-Commission of the German Stroke Society and the German Atrial Fibrillation NETwork. In patients with ischemic stroke, detection of atrial fibrillation should usually lead to a change in secondary stroke prevention, since oral anticoagulation is superior to antiplatelet drugs. The detection of previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation can be improved in patients with ischemic stroke to optimize stroke prevention. This paper summarizes the present knowledge on atrial fibrillation detection after ischemic stroke. We propose an interdisciplinary standard for a \"structured analysis of ECG monitoring\" on the stroke unit as well as a staged diagnostic scheme for the detection of atrial fibrillation.

        "title": "Pure single-port laparoscopic surgery or mix of techniques?",
        "text": "PURPOSE Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has emerged in the recent years as an alternative approach to conventional laparoscopic surgery which is accompanied by additional advantages over laparoscopy. In this work we attempt to review the current literature and to investigate the possible combination of LESS to other currently available approaches such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), needlescopic and robotic laparoscopic surgery. METHODS Extensive literature search on the topics of LESS, hybrid and pure NOTES, Needlescopic-assisted LESS and \"Robot-assisted LESS\" took place. Additionally, the accumulated experience from 118 LESSs performed in our departments is presented in an attempt to provide evidence regarding the mix of technique in LESS in urology. RESULTS The challenging nature of LESS limits the broader application and acceptance. Expanding experience in single-site surgery has currently provided tools such as transvaginal access, needlescopic instruments and robot assistance that can aid LESS and enhance its efficiency without compromising any of its advantages. A mix of these techniques with LESS could ease the stiff learning curve of the second and benefit not only its performance but also the adaptation of LESS as a standard practice. CONCLUSION Pure LESS although feasible, remains a technical challenge for the surgeon, preventing the widespread application of the technique. The goal of urologists on LESS surgery should not be the purity of LESS approach, but the superiority against already established techniques. A mix of techniques could be a key for the documentation of the advantages of LESS over conventional laparoscopy.",

We developed a new open-source real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay for M. cynos that performs well under standard rtPCR conditions. Primers and probes were designed to target the M. cynos tuf gene. Reaction efficiencies for the M. cynos tuf gene assay on 2 platforms were based on amplification of standard curves spanning 8 orders of magnitude: ABI 7500 platform, 94.3\u201397.9% (r(2) \u2265 0.9935); QuantStudio OpenArray platform, 119.1\u2013122.5% (r(2) = 0.9784). The assay performed very well over a range of template input, from 10(9) copies to the lower limit of quantification at 4 copies of the M. cynos genome on the ABI 7500 platform. Diagnostic performance was estimated by comparison with an in-house legacy assay on clinical specimens as well as testing isolates that were characterized previously by intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequencing. Exclusivity was established by testing 12 other Mycoplasma species. To substantiate the high specificity of the M. cynos tuf gene assay, sequence confirmation was performed on ISR PCR amplicons obtained from clinical specimens. One ISR amplicon sequence revealed M. mucosicanis rather than M. cynos. The complete protocol of the newly developed M. cynos tuf assay is provided to facilitate assay harmonization.",

        "text": "Effectively designing and evaluating public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate estimation of the weekly incidence of COVID-19. Unfortunately, a lack of systematic testing across the United States (US) due to equipment shortages and varying testing strategies has hindered the usefulness of the reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce three complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 during the early outbreak in each state in the US as well as in New York City, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, and COVID-19 mortality reports. Instead of relying on an estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our three approaches, there is a consistent conclusion that estimated state-level COVID-19 symptomatic case counts from March 1 to April 4, 2020 varied from 5 to 50 times greater than the official positive test counts. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases in the US as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.2 to 5.1 million cases, with possibly as high as 8.1 million cases, up to 26 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our method to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 6.0 to 12.2 million, which compares with 1.5 million positive test counts. Our approaches demonstrate the value of leveraging existing influenza-like-illness surveillance systems during the flu season for measuring the burden of new diseases that share symptoms with influenza-like-illnesses. Our methods may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during upcoming flu seasons in the US and other countries with comparable influenza surveillance systems.",

        "text": "In this paper, we present a novel method for line artefacts quantification in lung ultrasound (LUS) images of COVID-19 patients. We formulate this as a non-convex regularisation problem involving a sparsity-enforcing, Cauchy-based penalty function, and the inverse Radon transform. We employ a simple local maxima detection technique in the Radon transform domain, associated with known clinical definitions of line artefacts. Despite being non-convex, the proposed technique is guaranteed to convergence through our proposed Cauchy proximal splitting (CPS) method and accurately identifies both horizontal and vertical line artefacts in LUS images. In order to reduce the number of false and missed detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line identification method and show a considerable performance gain with 87% correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In addition, owing to its fast convergence, our proposed method is readily applicable for processing LUS image sequences.",

Interactions of the viral replicase complex with cis-acting RNA elements located in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-terminal genome regions ensure the specific replication of viral RNA. Over the past years, boundaries and structures of cis-acting RNA elements required for coronavirus genome replication have been extensively characterized in betacoronaviruses and, to a lesser extent, other coronavirus genera. Here, we review our current understanding of coronavirus cis-acting elements located in the terminal genome regions and use a combination of bioinformatic and RNA structure probing studies to identify and characterize putative cis-acting RNA elements in alphacoronaviruses. The study suggests significant RNA structure conservation among members of the genus Alphacoronavirus but also across genus boundaries. Overall, the conservation pattern identified for 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-terminal RNA structural elements in the genomes of alpha- and betacoronaviruses is in agreement with the widely used replicase polyprotein-based classification of the Coronavirinae, suggesting co-evolution of the coronavirus replication machinery with cognate cis-acting RNA elements.",

METHODS Eight hundred and three patients undergoing 871 consecutive hip and knee arthroplasties (including sixty-one in patients with inflammatory arthritis and 810 in patients with noninflammatory arthritis) were prospectively evaluated for periprosthetic joint infection. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and synovial fluid white blood-cell count with differential were obtained routinely. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to establish optimal thresholds for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection, and the area under the curve was calculated to determine the overall accuracy of these tests for patients with inflammatory compared with noninflammatory arthritis. RESULTS The utility of all serum and synovial tests for predicting chronic periprosthetic joint infection was similar for patients with noninflammatory and inflammatory arthritis. The optimal cutoffs in patients with noninflammatory and inflammatory arthritis were 32 and 30 mm/hr, respectively, for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; 15 and 17 mg/L, respectively, for the C-reactive protein level; 3450/\u03bcL and 3444/\u03bcL, respectively, for the synovial fluid white blood-cell count; and 78% and 75%, respectively, for the differential. The areas under the curves were similar for the two groups (84.9% and 85.0%, respectively, for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; 88.5% and 85.1%, respectively, for the C-reactive protein level; 94.5% and 93.8%, respectively, for the synovial fluid white blood-cell count, and 95.0% and 93.6%, respectively, for the differential). Finally, the sensitivities, specificities, negative predictive values, and positive predictive values for all tests were also comparable in both groups. The rate of periprosthetic joint infection was significantly higher following procedures in patients with inflammatory arthritis than following procedures in patients with noninflammatory arthritis (31% compared with 18%; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and synovial fluid white blood-cell count with differential are useful for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection in patients with inflammatory as well as noninflammatory arthritis, with similar optimal cutoff values and overall testing performance. The synovial fluid white blood-cell count and differential performed the best for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection. Physicians evaluating patients with a failed or painful total hip or knee arthroplasty should not assume that elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and synovial fluid white blood-cell count with differential is secondary to inflammatory arthropathy; rather, elevation of these markers may indicate periprosthetic joint infection, and further evaluation for infection is warranted.",

We have reviewed original articles, case reports, and existing open-source data-sets to delineate the spectrum of neurological disorders potentially observed in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. Neurological involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) corresponds to three situations: (a) neurological manifestations of viral infection, (b) post-infective neurological complications, and (c) infection in patients with neurological co-morbidity. Neurological manifestations can further be subdivided into the central nervous system (headache, dizziness, alteration of the sensorium, ataxia encephalitis, stroke, and seizures) and peripheral nervous system (skeletal muscle injury and peripheral nerve involvement including hyposmia and hypogeusia) symptomatology. Post-infective neurological complications include demyelinating conditions. Reduced mobility and dementia as co-morbidities may predispose a patient to have a viral infection. It is concluded that the pandemic of COVID-19 presents for a neurologist some unique challenges.

        "text": "ABSTRACT Objectives Initial data on Covid-19 infection has pointed out a special vulnerability of elderly people. Design we performed a meta-analysis with available national reports at May 7th 2020 from China, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and New York State. Analyses were performed by a random effects model and sensitivity analyses were performed for the identification of potential sources of heterogeneity. Setting and Participants: covid-19 positive patients reported in literature and national reports. Measures all-cause mortality by age. Results A total of 611,1583 subjects were analyzed and 141,745 (23.2%) had age \u226580. The percentage of octogenarians was different in the 5 registries being the lowest in China (3.2%) and the highest and the highest in UK and New York State. The overall mortality rate was 12.10% and it varied widely between countries being the lowest in China (3.1%) and the highest in UK (20.8%) and New York State (20.99%). Mortality was <1.1% in patients with age <50 and it increased exponentially after that age in the 5 national registries. As expected, the highest mortality rate was observed in patients \u226580 years old. All age groups had significantly higher mortality compared to the inmediatelly younger age group. The largest increase in mortality risk was observed in patients with age 60-69 compared to 50-59 (OR: 3.13 95% CI 2.61-3.76). Conclusions and implications this metanalysis with more than half-million of Covid-19 patients from different countries highlights the determinant effect of age on mortality with the relevant thresholds on age >50 and, especially, >60.

        "text": "BACKGROUND Paediatric arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) is an important cause of acute neurological symptoms in children, it causes significant morbidity and is one of the top ten causes of childhood deaths. Consensus papers have suggested guidelines for the management of AIS in childhood, although none recommend thrombectomy. Despite this, children within our institution have undergone mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion. This is the first series of mechanical thrombectomy and outcomes performed in children in the U.K. METHODS We describe the endovascular management of paediatric arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) in four children (5-15 years) with PedNIHSS > 17. RESULTS Three had basilar artery (BA) occlusion and one left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. All underwent uncomplicated thrombectomy followed by intravenous heparin. One had a successful second attempt. The BA cases underwent thrombectomy 17-36 h after symptom onset; the left MCA case <6 h after symptom onset. Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) was 0-3, 50% had MRS 0. DISCUSSION Adult AIS guidelines recommend IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) within 4.5 h of onset and intra-arterial r-tPA within 6 h; thrombectomy being reserved for carefully selected patients. Paediatric AIS recognition is problematic, often with delayed imaging. There is little evidence regarding efficacy of thrombectomy for paediatric AIS. Our experience suggests there may be a role for endovascular clot retrieval in selected patients managed by an experienced multidisciplinary team. Careful data collection is mandatory.",

A redrawn landscape highlights viruses as active players in the phytobiome, and surveys have uncovered their positive roles in environmental stress tolerance of plants. Viral infectious clones are key tools for functional characterization of known and newly identified viruses. Knowledge of viruses and their components has been instrumental for the development of modern plant molecular biology and biotechnology. In this review, we provide extensive guidelines built on current synthetic biology advances that streamline infectious clone assembly, thus lessening a major technical constraint of plant virology. The focus is on generation of infectious clones in binary T\u2010DNA vectors, which are delivered efficiently to plants by Agrobacterium. We then summarize recent applications of plant viruses and explore emerging trends in microbiology, bacterial and human virology that, once translated to plant virology, could lead to the development of virus\u2010based gene therapies for ad hoc engineering of plant traits. The systematic characterization of plant virus roles in the phytobiome and next\u2010generation virus\u2010based tools will be indispensable landmarks in the synthetic biology roadmap to better crops.",

The results indicate the division of isolates into two different genotypes of IBV within the province, Massachusetts (Mass)-like and QX-like. The IBV Mass-like genotype was the most prevalent and was detected in 79% of the full spike protein S1 gene sequences. Variation up to 22.3% was detected within local Mass-type strains, supporting the hypothesis that multiple IBV serotypes may co-circulate in the same region simultaneously. Additionally, more conservation was observed amongst Mass serotypes versus QX-like serotypes, implying that vaccine use can influence the variability within the IBV population; this is deduced from the fact that the only live vaccine registered for use in South Africa at the time of the study was of Mass origin and no QX-like vaccines were available for use.

In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.",

Evidence suggests that coronavirus mRNAs are generated by a mechanism of leader primed transcription. Leader RNA binds to consensus sequences upstream of each gene on full length negative strand viral RNA and transcription proceeds to the 5' end of the negative strand to produce the nested set of mRNAs. Even though this gives rise to polycistronic mRNA species only the 5' extension of each mRNA is translated to give the viral proteins. The leader RNA for TGEV is about 90 nucleotides long and contains the sequence which recognises the leader binding sites on the negative strand RNA. Evidence suggests that the length of the leader binding sequence may be involved in transcriptional control of individual mRNAs. In order to investigate this a virus specific mRNA isolation method was developed to measure the relative amounts of mRNAs synthesised during an infection of LLC-PK1 cells with TGEV (strain FS772/70).

        "title": "\"Off-label\" use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir and chloroquine in COVID-19: A survey of cardiac adverse drug reactions by the French Network of Pharmacovigilance Centers",
        "text": "INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for physicians and scientists. Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences. METHODS: Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with \"off-label\" use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance. Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs. We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 103 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (86%), or associated with azithromycin (60%). Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting. Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%). There were 8 sudden, unexplained or aborted deaths (7%), 8 ventricular arrhythmias (7%), 90 reports of prolonged QTc (75%) most of them \"serious\" (64%), 48 of which proved &#8805; 500ms, 20 reports of severe conduction disorders (17%) and 5 reports of other cardiac causes (4%). Six reports derived from automedication. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: \"Off-label\" use of treatments in COVID-19 increases the risk of cardiac ADRs, some of them avoidable. Even if these drugs are perceived as familiar, they are used in patients with added risk factors caused by infection. Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk, even if they will be proven efficacious.",

        "text": "The earthquake of November 2017, the great flood of April 2019, and the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 are 3 major emergencies in Iran during the last 3 years. A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of \"trust.\" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.",

A large number of natural compounds are under trial for screening compounds, possessing potential inhibitory effect against the viral infection. Keeping in view the importance of marine compounds in antiviral activity, we investigated the potency of some marine natural products to target SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID 6MO3). The crystallographic structure of Mpro in an apo form was retrieved from Protein Data Bank and marine compounds from PubChem. These structures were prepared for docking and the complex with good docking score was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100 ns. To measure the stability, flexibility, and average distance between the target and compounds, root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the distance matrix were calculated. Among five marine compounds, C-1 (PubChem CID 11170714) exhibited good activity, interacting with the active site and surrounding residues, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The C-1 also attained a stable dynamic behavior, and the average distance between compound and target remains constant. In conclusion, marine natural compounds may be used as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 for better management of COVID-19.[Figure: see text].",

The term health diplomacy has been used to describe this growing interface between foreign policy and global health, and it encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals. The Chinese presence in Africa has grown in the last 15 years, generating increased interest in Sino-African relations. While much has been written in recent years about the Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are small-scale traders and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised. In this paper, we consider how a health diplomacy approach could be applied to African migrants in China, and the potential advantages and limitations of this strategy. We identify areas of overlap between public health, trade and foreign policy goals that can be emphasised to generate support for improved services for African migrants in China and to engage partners from a diversity of sectors.",

The present survey was conducted to explore the sources of information /misinformation for healthcare professionals from India. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey using snowballing technique was conducted from 24 Mar to 10 Apr 2020. The questionnaire was pretested and developed using standard techniques. It was circulated among medical students and physicians. Data were analysed using the STATA software. RESULTS: Data of 758 participants were analysed. A total of 255 (33.6%) medical students, 335 (44.2%) nonspecialists and 168 (22.1%) specialists participated. The most common source of formal and informal information was official government websites and online news, respectively. A total of 517 (68.2%) participants accepted receiving misinformation. Social media and family and friends were the most common sources of misinformation. Seventy-two percent of participants agreed that spread of information helped to contain COVID-19, but more than that 75% agreed to having received inaccurate information. Seventy-four percent of respondents felt the need for regulation of information during such times; 26% and 33% felt that information about COVID-19 made them feel uncomfortable and distracts routine decision-making, respectively, and 50% felt it was difficult to differentiate correct from incorrect information about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study explored the sources of information and misinformation and found a high prevalence of misinformation, especially from social media. We suggest the need to better manage the flow of information so that it can be an effective weapon against SARS-CoV2. There is a need for doctors to adapt to the changing times of infodemics accompanying pandemics.",

Quantitative risk assessment methods in design and operational spaces are a significant aid to evaluating proposed design space boundaries. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a relatively simple strategy for design space definition using a simplified Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation. This paper builds on a previous paper that used failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) qualitative risk assessment and Plackett-Burman design of experiments to identity the critical quality attributes. The results show that the sequential use of qualitative and quantitative risk assessments can focus the design of experiments on a reduced set of critical material and process parameters that determine a robust design space under conditions of limited laboratory experimentation.

In China, a country stereotyped as a major source of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, research on the public understanding of animal influenza is limited to the Han, the main ethnic group. The present qualitative study in Southwest China investigated awareness of animal influenza among the Dai, an ethnic minority. The participants (15 men and 10 women, ages 18\u201383) were smallholder farmers of pigs and poultry in rural areas of Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. A mixture of interviews and group discussions took place in homes and villages. The participants were asked about their knowledge of avian influenza (H7N9), swine influenza (H1N1), precautions taken to protect against influenza, procedures when animals were sick and perceived risk of animal influenza. The data were analysed following coding and thematic analysis. The findings demonstrated a limited understanding of animal health and welfare among participants. Specifically, they were largely unaware of animal influenza (H7N9, H1N1) including its causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment. The farmers were also uninformed of the risks they faced and unknowingly engaged in behaviours which increased direct or indirect exposure to infected animals, a risk factor for human infection. They also reported poor usage of veterinary services. In order to guarantee the health, welfare and production of their livestock, immediate action is needed to enable Dai smallholder farmers to prevent and respond to animal influenza effectively and timely.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761-12\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764-128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70-24\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

However, recent studies have detailed that the overall distribution of therapeutic nanoparticles (NP) following CED remains poor due to tissue inhomogeneity and anatomical barriers present in the brain, which has limited its translational applicability. Using probe NP, we first demonstrate that a significantly improved brain distribution is achieved by infusing small, non-adhesive NP via CED in a hyperosmolar infusate solution. This multimodal delivery strategy minimizes the hindrance of NP diffusion imposed by the brain extracellular matrix and reduces NP confinement within the perivascular spaces. We further recapitulate the distributions achieved by CED of this probe NP using a most widely explored biodegradable polymer-based drug delivery NP. These findings provide a strategy to overcome several key limitations of CED that have been previously observed in clinical trials.",

Earlier, killed or attenuated pathogens were employed for vaccine development. But in present era, the peptide vaccines are in much trend and are favoured over whole vaccines because of their superiority over conventional vaccines. These vaccines are either based on single proteins or on synthetic peptides including several B-cell and T-cell epitopes. However, the overall mechanism of action remains the same and works by prompting the immune system to activate the specific B-cell- and T-cell-mediated responses against the pathogen. Rino Rappuoli and others have contributed in this field by plotting the design of the most potent and fully computational approach for discovery of potential vaccine candidates which is popular as reverse vaccinology. This is quite an unambiguous advance for vaccine evolution where one begins with the genome information of the pathogen and ends up with the list of certain epitopes after application of multiple bioinformatics tools.

        "text": "Some cancer patients treated with Atezolizumab, PD-L1 antibody drug launched by Genentech, quickly developed anti-drug antibody (ADA), led to loss of efficacy. This was likely due to the heavy aggregation of Atezolizumab, caused by mutation of N297A for removing unwanted antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) of IgG1 antibody drug. Here, we developed a new version of Atezolizumab (Maxatezo), which was demonstrated better anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. In Atezolizumab, we mutated 297A to 297N back to bring back the glycosylation, and inserted a short sequence GGGS between G237 and G238 in the hinge region of the IgG1 heavy chain. Our data shown that insertion of GGGS, without altering the anti-PD-L1 antibody affinity and inhibitory activity, completely abolished the ADCC activity, as same as Atezolizumab. Moreover, the insertion of GGGS, without altering the glycosylation profile of IgG1, increased the yields of anti-PD-L1 antibody considerately. Additionally, glycosylation improved the stability yet reduced the amounts of aggregations in the antibody solutions. In turn, the level of ADA in animals treated with Maxatezo was 70% lower than the ones treated with Atezolizumab. Most importantly, at the same 10mg/kg dose, the anti-tumor activity of Maxatezo had attained 98% compared to that of Atezolizumab at 68%.",

        "text": "Cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains a significant public health challenge. l-Tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP), a well-tolerated and nonaddictive compound, shows promise for the management of CUD. Its pharmacologic profile includes blockade at dopamine and other monoamine receptors and attenuation of cocaine self-administration, reinstatement, and rewarding properties in rats. This study evaluated the safety of l-THP in human cocaine users and its influence on the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cocaine. Twenty-four cocaine-using adult men were randomized to receive l-THP (30 mg twice a day orally) or placebo double-blind for 4 days, with an intranasal cocaine (40 mg) challenge on the fourth day. Safety and tolerability were evaluated using vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, and standardized self-report instruments. Peripheral venous blood was collected periodically and later assayed for l-THP and cocaine using highly sensitive and specific ultraperformance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD) methods. Twenty subjects completed the study, of whom 19 provided complete PK data. The short 3.5-day course of l-THP was safe and well tolerated and did not affect cocaine's PK or its acute cardiovascular effects. The cocaine AUC0\u2192\u221e was 211.5 and 261.4 h\u00b7ng/mL, and the Cmax was 83.3 and 104.5 ng/mL for the l-THP and placebo groups, respectively. In addition there were no significant differences in the number of side effects reported in each group (l-THP group 22 [48%], placebo group 24 [52%]) or vital signs including, heart rate, blood pressure, complete blood count, or ECG. These findings suggest that oral THP has promise for further development as a treatment for CUD.",

        "text": "The vascular endothelium can be considered as an organ/tissue which comprises a monolayer of endothelial cells which serve as a semipermeable cellular barrier separating the inner space of blood vessels from its surrounding tissue and to control the exchange of fluids and cells between the two compartments. Since the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output, the large surface area of the lung microvasculature is well suited for sensing mechanical, chemical, and cellular injury by inhaled or circulating substances. This endothelial barrier is dynamically regulated through exposure to these various stimuli of physiological and pathological origin and serves to regulate multiple key biological processes (including lung fluid balance and solute transport between vascular compartments). For example, an increase in vascular permeability is a necessary feature of the body\u2019s defense mechanism to provide injured tissues with access to leucocytes, resulting in tissue edema due to fluid extravasation. However, during conditions of intense lung inflammation such as observed in acute lung injury or its severer form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the large surface area becomes a liability and provides the opportunity for profound vascular permeability resulting in massive fluid accumulation in the alveolar space and progressively leading to pulmonary failure. Alterations in vascular permeability occur not only in acute inflammatory lung disorders primarily caused by sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma which result in high rates of patient morbidity and mortality, but are an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in subacute lung inflammatory disorders such as ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, radiation lung injury, and asthma.

        "text": "Good management, supported by accurate, timely and reliable health information, is vital for increasing the effectiveness of Health Information Systems (HIS). When it comes to managing the under-resourced health systems of developing countries, information-based decision making is particularly important. This paper reports findings of a self-report survey that investigated perceptions of local health managers (HMs) of their own regional HIS in Sri Lanka. Data were collected through a validated, pre-tested postal questionnaire, and distributed among a selected group of HMs to elicit their perceptions of the current HIS in relation to information generation, acquisition and use, required reforms to the information system and application of information and communication technology (ICT). Results based on descriptive statistics indicated that the regional HIS was poorly organised and in need of reform; that management support for the system was unsatisfactory in terms of relevance, accuracy, timeliness and accessibility; that political pressure and community and donor requests took precedence over vital health information when management decisions were made; and use of ICT was unsatisfactory. HIS strengths included user-friendly paper formats, a centralised planning system and an efficient disease notification system; weaknesses were lack of comprehensiveness, inaccuracy, and lack of a feedback system. Responses of participants indicated that HIS would be improved by adopting an internationally accepted framework and introducing ICT applications. Perceived barriers to such improvements were high initial cost of educating staff to improve computer literacy, introduction of ICTS, and HIS restructure. We concluded that the regional HIS of Central Province, Sri Lanka had failed to provide much-needed information support to HMS. These findings are consistent with similar research in other developing countries and reinforce the need for further research to verify causes of poor performance and to design strategic reforms to improve HIS in regional Sri Lanka.",

It exposes a small amino-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side and a carboxyterminal, glycosylated domain on the exoplasmic side of the membrane. When the exoplasmic domain of I\u03b3 is replaced by the cytoplasmic protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), CAT becomes the exoplasmic, glycosylated domain of the resulting membrane protein I\u03b3CAT\u2217. Deletion of the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain from I\u03b3CAT gives rise to a secreted protein from which an amino-terminal segment is cleaved, most likely by signal peptidase.

        "text": "AIM: To determine if pain is associated with 12-month incidence of mood affective disorders (MAD) in adults with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD: Data from Optum Clinformatics\u00ae Data Mart (2013-2016) were used for this retrospective cohort study. Diagnostic codes were used to identify adults (&#8805;18y) with CP, incident cases of MAD, and covariates (other neurodevelopmental conditions, sleep disorders, arthritis). Pain (any type, location) was identified between 1st October 2014 and 30th September 2015. The pain group was divided into new or consistent pain if they had a history of pain (i.e. consistent) in the 12 months before their first pain claim date. Crude incidence rates of MAD (expressed per 100 person-years) were estimated. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of MAD after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Adults that had new pain (n=859; incidence rate=15.5) or consistent pain (n=1303; incidence rate=17.9) had greater crude incidence rate of MAD compared to adults without pain (n=3726; incidence rate=5.9). The elevated rate of MAD remained after adjusting for covariates, for new pain (hazard ratio=2.4; 95% CI=1.9-3.0) and consistent pain (hazard ratio=2.1; 95% CI=1.7-2.7). INTERPRETATION: Pain is associated with greater incidence of MAD in adults with CP. This association remained after accounting for potential confounding factors. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What this paper adds Pain was associated with higher 12-month incidence of mood affective disorders (MAD). The 12-month MAD incidence was similar between new and consistent pain groups. The MAD incidence remained higher adjusting for neurodevelopmental comorbidities, sleep disorders, and arthritis.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: When the coronavirus pandemic caused widespread school and business closures in March 2020, blood drives were cancelled and the supply of blood decreased suddenly in the United States (US). In response, hospital\u2010based transfusion medicine physicians instituted policies to conserve blood and decrease blood product usage. These efforts were aided by the US Surgeon General recommendation to cancel all elective procedures. Nevertheless, the duration, severity, and impact of the pandemic on the national blood supply was uncertain. Hospitals with in\u2010house donor programs had the opportunity not only to control demand, but also increase supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A hospital\u2010based blood donor center was rapidly mobilized to increase the supply of in\u2010house collected blood, in order to counteract a sudden but potentially long\u2010term depletion of the national blood supply during a pandemic. RESULTS: Collections increased approximately five\u2010fold above baseline for whole blood units, while apheresis platelet units were maintained at the historical average for the blood donor center. Cancellation of elective procedures showed a modest, but not yet statistically significant decrease in average blood product usage per day, nevertheless the in\u2010house collection rate was sufficient to meet demand. CONCLUSION: A hospital\u2010based blood donor center can quickly increase collection volumes and capacity in the face of a national emergency / pandemic. The desire to collect units should be balanced with safety concerns, need for sustainability, and blood product demand. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

        "text": "During Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection hepatitis is a potentially life threatening complication, particularly in newborns. Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-\u03b2 reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-\u03b2 responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.",

Safety and reliability are considered by patients and clinicians when selecting among the different models of cochlear implants.

This paper develops a classification scheme for cochlear implant failures wherein each failure report is categorized based on the failure site, cause, mode, and mechanism obtained through failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis. Failure parameters based on the Weibull distribution are used to quantify the following reliability metrics: B1, B5, B10, and B50 lives. The developed reporting scheme provides clear and quantitative information on failure causes and failure sites for a given implant.

        "text": "PURPOSE To validate a monitored, breath-hold positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) acquisition technique for the minimization of respiratory PET/CT image misregistration and lesion distortion during PET/CT-guided percutaneous interventional procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven patients referred for percutaneous biopsy or thermal ablation of tumors near the diaphragm were prospectively enrolled. Initial PET/CT scanning was performed by using a bellows device and monitored, same-level breath-holds for PET and CT acquisitions. Breath-hold PET consisted of nine 20-second breath-hold frames, yielding a 3-minute equivalent PET dataset. A second PET/CT scan was obtained without monitoring by using end-expiration breath-hold CT and free-breathing PET. PET/CT tumor misregistration and craniocaudal tumor diameter were measured on monitored and unmonitored PET/CT datasets. Data were analyzed by using nonparametric, two-sided, signed-rank statistical tests. RESULTS Mean PET/CT image misregistrations in the craniocaudal, anteroposterior, and transverse planes were 2.6 mm (range, 0-7 mm), 3.3 mm (range, 1-8 mm), and 2.7 mm (range, 0-8 mm) with monitoring and 14.7 mm (range, 0-49 mm), 7.6 mm (range, 1-24 mm), and 4.0 mm (range, 0-12 mm) without monitoring, respectively. Differences were significant for craniocaudal (P = .0087) and anteroposterior (P = .014) planes, but not for the transverse plane (P = .23). Mean craniocaudal target diameter was 2.5 mm (range, -2 to 9 mm) larger (ie, distorted) for unmonitored versus monitored PET (P = .061). CONCLUSIONS Acquiring PET/CT datasets with respiratory bellows-assisted, monitored breath-holds improves PET/CT image registration versus unmonitored PET/CT and may facilitate accurate targeting during PET/CT-guided interventions in anatomic regions subject to respiratory motion.",

        "text": "Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model is widely used to mimic human focal ischemic stroke in order to study ischemia/reperfusion brain injury in rodents. In tMCAO model, intraluminal suture technique is widely used to achieve ischemia and reperfusion. However, variation of infarct volume in this model often requires large sample size, which hinders the progress of preclinical research. Our previous study demonstrated that infarct volume was related to the success of reperfusion although the reason remained unclear. The aim of present study is to explore the relationship between focal thrombus formation and model reproducibility with respect to infarct volume. We hypothesize that suture-induced thrombosis causes infarct volume variability due to insufficient reperfusion after suture withdrawal. Seventy-two adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90 minutes of tMCAO with or without intraperitoneal administration of heparin. Dynamic synchrotron radiation microangiography (SRA) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were performed before and after tMCAO to observe the cerebral vascular morphology and to measure the cerebral blood flow in vivo. Infarct volume and neurological score were examined to evaluate severity of ischemic brain injury. We found that the rate of successful reperfusion was much higher in heparin-treated mice compared to that in heparin-free mice according to the result of SRA and LSCI at 1 and 3 hours after suture withdrawal (p<0.05). Pathological features and SRA revealed that thrombus formed in the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery or anterior cerebral artery, which blocked reperfusion following tMCAO. LSCI showed that cortical collateral circulation could be disturbed by thrombi. Our results demonstrated that suture-induced thrombosis was a critical element, which affects the success of reperfusion. Appropriate heparin management provides a useful approach for improving reproducibility of reperfusion model in mice.",

Materials and methods: Cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of professionals from 30 health centers and 30 nursing homes from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon. The work center, type of profession, COVID-19 infection, level of exposure, compliance with preventive measures, isolation (if required) and diagnostic tests carried out were collected. The determination of infection was made by differentiated rapid diagnostic test (dRDT), using a finger-stick whole-blood sample. The association of variables with infection was assessed by multivariable non-conditional logistic regression. The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated according to two scenarios for RDT (Sensitivity=0.6 and Specificity=0.985; Sensitivity=0.8 and Specificity=1). Results: The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 4.9% - 11.0%. The observed prevalence was 5.9%, being higher in nursing home compared to primary care centers (9.5% vs. 5.5%). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, type of professional, level of exposure or compliance with preventive measures. Conclusions: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group is low. A high number of professionals remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore protective measures should be taken, especially in nursing home professionals.

        "text": "ACE2, in concert with the protease TMPRSS2, binds the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates its cellular entry. The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral RNA was also detected in breast milk (Wu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that ACE2 expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation, which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone enhancer marks and additional transcription components.

Uveitis patients require particular attention because of their theoretical risk of viral infection, in the context of therapeutic immunosuppression. AREAS COVERED: This collaborative work proposes practical management and follow-up criteria for uveitis patients in the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: Management should proceed as usual when access to healthcare is possible in patients who do not belong to a group at high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection; and in uncontrolled uveitis cases. In case of reduced access to eye clinics or high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients' management should be stratified based on their clinical presentation. In non-severe uveitis cases, the use of systemic steroids should be avoided, and local steroids preferred whenever possible. In uncontrolled situations where there is real risk of permanent visual loss, high-dose intravenous steroids and/or systemic immunosuppressants and/or biotherapies can be administered depending on the severity of eye disease. Immunosuppressive therapy should not be withheld, unless the patient develops SARS-CoV2 infection.",

Taiwan has effectively contained COVID-19 community transmission. We aimed to validate whether fighting COVID-19 could help to control other respiratory infections in Taiwan. METHOD: We collected week-case data of severe influenza, invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae disease and death toll from pneumonia among 25 calendar weeks of the influenza season for four years (2016-2020), which were reported to Taiwan CDC. Trend and slope differences between years were compared. RESULT: A downturn trend of severe influenza, invasive S. pneumoniae disease and the death toll from pneumonia per week in 2019/2020 season and significant trend difference in comparison to previous seasons were noted, especially after initiation of several disease prevention measures to fight potential COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common outpatient diagnosis in gastroenterology and has a high prevalence in the general population. As many as 40% of patients with GERD have incomplete response to medical therapy, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying lack of response are now better understood. Novel medical and minimally invasive interventions are available to optimize management of GERD. Esophageal cancer, regardless of the histological subtype, has among the worst survival statistics among all malignancies. Taking advantage of technological advances in genome sequencing, the mutational spectra in esophageal cancer are now emerging, offering novel avenues for targeted therapies. Early diagnosis is another strand for improving survival. While genome-wide association studies are providing insights into genetic susceptibility, novel approaches to early detection of cancer are being devised through the use of biomarkers applied to esophageal samples and as part of imaging technologies. Dysmotility and eosinophilic esophagitis are the differential diagnoses in patients with dysphagia. New pathophysiological classifications have improved the management of motility disorders. Meanwhile, exciting progress has been made in the endoscopic management of these conditions. Eosinophilic esophagitis is still a relatively new entity, and the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. However, it is now clear that an allergic reaction to food plays an important role, and dietary interventions as well as biologic agents to block the inflammatory cascade are novel, promising fields of clinical research.",

The most common helminthic infections that can cause eosinophilic meningitis (EoM) in the US, neuroangiostrongyliasis and baylisascariasis, share many of the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases. Neuroangiostrongyliasis, a rodent zoonosis caused by the rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, is now endemic in the US following the importation of infected rats on container ships and African land snails, the parasite's intermediate hosts, as biological controls and exotic pets. Baylisascariasis, a raccoon zoonosis, caused by the raccoon roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis, has extended its US distribution range from suburban neighborhoods in the northern US to the Southeast and West Coast since the 1980s. Both A. cantonensis and B. procyonis are now enzootic in Louisiana and have caused EoM in humans. This review analyzes scientific articles selected by MEDLINE search, 1966-2008, in order to assess the evolving epidemiology of EoM in the US, and specifically in Louisiana; and to alert Louisiana clinicians to populations at increased risk of helminthic EoM as a result of age, ethnicity, lifestyle, food choices, location of permanent residence, or recent travel in the Americas or Caribbean.

It has previously been shown that there is a convergence of neck proprioceptive and vestibular input within the cerebellum to provide a head-on-body reference frame (Manzoni et al. in Neuroscience 93:1095-1107, 1999). The objective of this experiment was to determine whether the direction of the postural response to a vestibular perturbation is modulated when function of the cerebellar vermis is temporarily depressed. Twenty participants were randomly assigned to a SHAM group (paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation) or a TEST group (continuous theta burst stimulation). Stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) was applied to standing subjects with their head facing forward or over their left shoulder. Cumulant density traces were established between the SVS and shear force over 180\u00b0, and the peak amplitude determined the direction of sway. There were no significant changes in sway direction when the head was facing forward for either stimulation (TEST or SHAM; p = 0.889) or when the head was facing over the shoulder for the SHAM condition (p = 0.954). There was, however, a significant change in sway direction when the head was turned with a depressed cerebellum (p = 0.018); from the expected antero-posterior direction, orthogonal to head orientation, to one slightly more mediolateral with respect to the feet. These results suggest the cerebellum plays a role in the integration of input to generate an appropriately directed postural response relative to the head position.",

DESIGN: Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 infection-related gene expression from endometrial transcriptomic data sets. SETTING: Infertility research department affiliated with a public hospital. PATIENT(S): Gene expression data from five studies in 112 patients with normal endometrium collected throughout the menstrual cycle. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gene expression and correlation between viral infectivity genes and age throughout the menstrual cycle. RESULT(S): Gene expression was high for TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB, FURIN, MX1, and BSG; medium for TMPRSS2; and low for ACE2. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, and MX1 expression increased toward the window of implantation. TMPRSS4 expression was positively correlated with ACE2, CTSB, CTSL, MX1, and FURIN during several cycle phases; TMPRSS2 was not statistically significantly altered across the cycle. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, BSG, and MX1 expression increased with age, especially in early phases of the cycle. CONCLUSION(S): Endometrial tissue is likely safe from SARS-CoV-2 cell entry based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, but susceptibility increases with age. Further, TMPRSS4, along with BSG-mediated viral entry into cells, could imply a susceptible environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry via different mechanisms. Additional studies are warranted to determine the true risk of endometrial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and implications for fertility treatments.",

        "text": "Events in the last decade have taught us that we are now, more than ever, vulnerable to fatal zoonotic diseases such as those caused by haemorrhagic fever viruses, influenza, rabies and BSE/vCJD. Future research activities should focus on solutions to these problems arising at the interface between animals and humans. A 4-fold classification of emerging zoonoses was proposed: Type 1: from wild animals to humans (Hanta); Type 1 plus: from wild animals to humans with further human-to-human transmission (AIDS); Type 2: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans (Avian flu) and Type 2 plus: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans, with further human-to-human transmission (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The resulting holistic approach to emerging infections links microbiology, veterinary medicine, human medicine, ecology, public health and epidemiology. As emerging 'new' respiratory viruses are identified in many wild and domestic animals, issues of interspecies transmission have become of increasing concern. The development of safe and effective human and veterinary vaccines is a priority. For example, the spread of different influenza viruses has stimulated influenza vaccine development, just as the spread of Ebola and Marburg viruses has led to new approaches to filovirus vaccines. Interdisciplinary collaboration has become essential because of the convergence of human disease, animal disease and a common approach to biosecurity. High containment pathogens pose a significant threat to public health systems, as well as a major research challenge, because of limited experience in case management, lack of appropriate resources in affected areas and a limited number of animal research facilities in developed countries. Animal models that mimic certain diseases are key elements for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, as well as for the development and efficacy testing of therapeutics and vaccines.

Even though this is densely populated region and heavily impacted by COVID-19 with a high risk population, only 45.1% of the observed population wore in face masks in a correct way, and another 15.5% simply did not use masks at all. The remainder used masks incorrectly, which is evidence of the worst scenario of people believing that they are protected when they are not. This is among the first studies, to the best of our knowledge, that measures real life compliance with face masks during this COVID-19 pandemic.

        "text": "The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis and the immunological response to inflammation. The effects of lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well-studied. Here we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)+ /podoplanin (PDPN)+ lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated periodontitis and ligature-induced periodontitis. Further, PDPN+ / alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA)- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN+ / \u03b1SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the local administration of adeno-associated virus for vascular endothelial growth factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the area and number of PDPN+ / \u03b1SMA+ collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. Lastly, LYVE1+ / \u03b1SMA- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1+ / \u03b1SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls. Thus, our findings reveal an important role of local lymphatic drainage in periodontal inflammation-mediated alveolar bone loss. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

The potential benefits, clinical, and oncologic outcomes are still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and oncologic outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for right colon cancer using propensity score matching analysis. METHODS From December 2013 to June 2017, 174 patients underwent laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy through a single-incision (n = 32) or a conventional (n = 142) approach. The data were prospectively collected and the patients were matched at a radio of 1:1 according to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), previous abdominal surgeries, comorbidities, ASA score (\u2264 2/> 2), and pathologic stage. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in estimated blood loss, time to diet, postoperative pain score, length of hospital stay between the SILS and CLS groups. However, the SILS group showed longer operation time (175 (40) vs 145 (52.5), p = 0.011) and shorter incision length (4 (1.4) vs 7 (1.9), p < 0.001). There were 2 (6.3%) postoperative complications in the SILS group and 5 (15.6%) in the CLS group (p = 0.426). The pathologic outcomes were similar between two groups. The median follow-up period was 26.5 months in the SILS group and 34.9 months in the CLS group (p = 0.002). There were 3 recurrences (9.4%) in the SILS group and 3 (9.4%) in the CLS group. The 3-year disease-free survival rates were 92.4 and 93.8% (p = 0.984), and overall survival rates were 92.3 and 93.0% (p = 0.884) in the SILS and the CLS groups, respectively. No incisional hernia was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Though single-incision laparoscopic surgery for right colon cancer showed longer operation time in this study, it appears to be a safe and feasible option with comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes to conventional laparoscopic surgery.",

        "text": "Objectives To estimate the potential economic impact of pandemic influenza, associated behavioural responses, school closures, and vaccination on the United Kingdom. Design A computable general equilibrium model of the UK economy was specified for various combinations of mortality and morbidity from pandemic influenza, vaccine efficacy, school closures, and prophylactic absenteeism using published data. Setting The 2004 UK economy (the most up to date available with suitable economic data). Main outcome measures The economic impact of various scenarios with different pandemic severity, vaccination, school closure, and prophylactic absenteeism specified in terms of gross domestic product, output from different economic sectors, and equivalent variation. Results The costs related to illness alone ranged between 0.5% and 1.0% of gross domestic product (\u00a38.4bn to \u00a316.8bn) for low fatality scenarios, 3.3% and 4.3% (\u00a355.5bn to \u00a372.3bn) for high fatality scenarios, and larger still for an extreme pandemic. School closure increases the economic impact, particularly for mild pandemics. If widespread behavioural change takes place and there is large scale prophylactic absence from work, the economic impact would be notably increased with few health benefits. Vaccination with a pre-pandemic vaccine could save 0.13% to 2.3% of gross domestic product (\u00a32.2bn to \u00a338.6bn); a single dose of a matched vaccine could save 0.3% to 4.3% (\u00a35.0bn to \u00a372.3bn); and two doses of a matched vaccine could limit the overall economic impact to about 1% of gross domestic product for all disease scenarios. Conclusion Balancing school closure against \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and obtaining sufficient stocks of effective vaccine are more important factors in determining the economic impact of an influenza pandemic than is the disease itself. Prophylactic absence from work in response to fear of infection can add considerably to the economic impact.",

More recently, technologies have been developed\u2014or adapted from other fields, such as nanotechnology\u2014to allow for the real-time quantification of physical virion particles, while supplying additional information such as particle diameter concomitantly. These technologies have progressed to the stage of commercialization increasing the speed of viral titer measurements from hours to minutes, thus providing a significant advantage for many aspects of virology research and biotechnology applications. Additional advantages lie in the broad spectrum of virus species that may be measured and the possibility to determine the ratio of infectious to total particles. A series of disadvantages remain associated with these technologies, such as a low specificity for viral particles. In this review we will discuss these technologies by comparing four systems for real-time single virus particle analysis and quantification.",

Binding-site models using surface coverage ratios were utilized to analyze the signals from the HEMT-based sensors to extract the dissociation constants and predict the number of binding sites. Two dissociation constants, K D1 =0.0955nM, K D2 =51.23nM, were obtained by fitting the experimental results into the two-binding-site model. The result shows that this technique is more competitive than isotope-labeling electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).

Many drugs have shown promise for treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, up to date, no drugs have been confirmed as a definitive treatment for COVID-19. Trials such as the SOLIDARITY and RECOVERY are ongoing, and first results were announced in favour of therapy with dexamethasone with a significant trend showing greatest benefit among those patients requiring ventilation. The drawbacks of these trials include exposing the patients to drugs with well-documented systemic adverse effects or unknown complications of novel therapies without proof of clinical benefit. We present here the hypothesis that bronchial artery infusion could be an alternative for systemic drug infusion in COVID-19 trials with superadded benefits of high drug concentration and low systemic adverse effects. The concept of this idea has many uncertainties and no current clinical data to support. Perhaps, the technique should be first applied in animal models to determine its safety and calculate the effective dose of the drugs.

One hundred ninety-eight consecutive patients with surgical resection of a pituitary adenoma/cystic pituitary lesion were retrospectively analyzed, blinded to clinical data and histopathological diagnosis. Different morphologic criteria were assessed: signal intensity in T2/T1w images, pattern of contrast enhancement, size, super-/infrasellar extension, and invasion of the cavernous sinus. For validation of the criteria, a second independent patient cohort (n = 102) was analyzed for diagnostic accuracy of the criteria. We identified differences between subtypes of pituitary adenomas regarding morphological MRI criteria. Especially, ACTH-producing adenomas and GH-producing adenomas showed partially specific imaging features. Application of our criteria on the second patient cohort (n = 102) did however not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Only differentiation between cystic pituitary lesions and adenomas was facilitated using these criteria, but did not reach statistical significance in this cohort (P = 0.352). MRI criteria might facilitate differentiation between pituitary adenomas and cystic pituitary lesions, but not between subtypes of pituitary adenomas.

        "text": "The intersection of technological changes and societal evolution has transformed every aspect of human life. Technological advancements are transforming how healthcare knowledge is expanding and accelerating the outreach of critical medical services delivery (Jamal et al. in Health Information Management Journal 38(3):26\u201337, 2009). While this transformation facilitates new opportunities simultaneously it also introduces challenges (Jacobzone and Oxley, 2001). Appropriate Health Technology (HT) is vital to new and existing global health care programs. Therefore, qualified professionals who can safely guide the development, evaluation, installation, integration, performance assurance, and risk mitigation of HT must be in position to lead. Trained Clinical Engineers (CE) and Biomedical Engineers (BE) have been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the essential practitioners to providing this critically needed guidance. Over the past four years, a senior professional group participated in an international project that seeks evidence for the hypothesis - that the engagement of CE and BE in guiding HT - impacts positively on patient outcomes, while the alternative is that there is no difference. The group collected published data that was subjected to peer review screening; additional data qualification conditions are described in this paper. The project was initiated at the Global CE Summit during the first International Clinical Engineering and Health Technology Management Congress (ICEHTMC) in Hangzhou, China in October 2015 (Global Clinical Engineering Summit at the First International Clinical Engineering and Health Technology Management Congress, 2015). Following the adoption of a resolution to investigate CE contributions to the improvement of world health status, an international survey and literature survey were initiated. During the first two years of this project 150 case studies from 90 countries were identified covering the previous ten years. The results of this survey were presented to health leaders at the World Health Organization (WHO) World Health Assembly in 2016. Last year, 250 case studies were added including 35 more countries covering the 2016\u20132017 period. The combined project contains 400 qualified submissions from 125 countries. The conclusion was that engagement of CE and BME is critical for successful investment in HT and for achieving intended patient outcomes. This paper describes the project\u2019s plan, the results of the literature review performed, and the evidence identified during the process.",

        "text": "One of the hallmarks of the human CNS disease subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a high level of measles virus (MV) infection of oligodendrocytes. It is therefore surprising that there is only one previous report of MV infection of rat oligodendrocytes in culture and no reports of human oligodendrocyte infection in culture. In an attempt to develop a model system to study MV infection of oligodendrocytes, time-lapse confocal microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy (EM) were used to study infection of the human oligodendroglioma cell line, MO3.13. A rat oligodendrocyte cell line, OLN-93, was also studied as a control. MO3.13 cells were shown to be highly susceptible to MV infection and virus budding was observed from the surface of infected MO3.13 cells by EM. Analysis of the infection in real time and by immunocytochemistry revealed that virus spread occurred by cell-to-cell fusion and was also facilitated by virus transport in cell processes. MO3.13 cells were shown to express CD46, a MV receptor, but were negative for the recently discovered MV receptor, signaling leucocyte activation molecule (SLAM). Immunohistochemical studies on SSPE tissue sections demonstrated that CD46 was also expressed on populations of human oligodendrocytes. SLAM expression was not detected on oligodendrocytes. These studies, which are the first to show MV infection of human oligodendrocytes in culture, show that the cells are highly susceptible to MV infection and this model cell line has been used to further our understanding of MV spread in the CNS.",

        "text": "OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on imaging utilization across practice settings. The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the composition of inpatient imaging volumes for modality types and Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective study of inpatient imaging volumes in a large health care system was performed, analyzing weekly imaging volumes by modality types (radiography, CT, MRI, ultrasound, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine) in years 2020 and 2019. The data set was split to compare pre-COVID-19 (weeks 1-9) and post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-16) periods. Further subanalyses compared early post-COVID-19 (weeks 10-13) and late post-COVID-19 (weeks 14-16) periods. Statistical comparisons were performed using &#967;2 and independent-samples t tests. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, total inpatient imaging volume in 2020 post-COVID-19, early and late post-COVID-19 periods, declined by 13.6% (from 78,902 to 68,168), 16.6% (from 45,221 to 37,732), and 9.6% (from 33,681 to 30,436), respectively. By week 16, inpatient imaging volume rebounded and was only down 4.2% (from 11,003 to 10,546). However, a statistically significant shift (P < .0001) in the 2020 composition mix was observed largely comprised of radiography (74.3%), followed by CT (12.7%), ultrasound (8%), MRI (2.4%), interventional radiology (2.3%) and nuclear medicine (0.4%). Although the vast majority of imaging studies declined, few Current Procedural Terminology-coded groups showed increased trends in imaging volumes in the late post-COVID-19 period, including CTA chest, radiography chest, and ultrasound venous duplex. DISCUSSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a decrease in inpatient imaging volumes accompanied by a shift away from cross-sectional imaging toward radiography. These findings could have significant implications in planning for a potential resurgence.",

        "title": "AGS Position Statement: Resource Allocation Strategies and Age-Related Considerations in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond",
        "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact older adults disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk. Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention on how resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion, inappropriately disfavoring older adults. This statement represents the official policy position of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS). It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations to consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. Members of the AGS Ethics Committee collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics, law, nursing, and medicine (including geriatrics, palliative care, emergency medicine, and pulmonology/critical care) to conduct a structured literature review and examine relevant reports. The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and deemphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced age. The AGS positions include (1) avoiding age per se as a means for excluding anyone from care; (2) assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate impact of social determinants of health; (3) encouraging decision makers to focus primarily on potential short-term (not long-term) outcomes; (4) avoiding ancillary criteria such as \"life-years saved\" and \"long-term predicted life expectancy\" that might disadvantage older people; (5) forming and staffing triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources; (6) developing institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied uniformly; and (7) facilitating appropriate advance care planning. The statement includes recommendations that should be immediately implemented to address resource allocation strategies during COVID-19, aligning with AGS positions. The statement also includes recommendations for post-pandemic review. Such review would support revised strategies to ensure that governments and institutions have equitable emergency resource allocation strategies, avoid future discriminatory language and practice, and have appropriate guidance to develop national frameworks for emergent resource allocation decisions.

Here we found PRRSV A2MC2 induced type I IFNs in cultured cells. A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells resulted in the synthesis of IFN-\u03b12 protein, transcript elevation of the IFN-stimulated genes ISG15 and ISG56, and the proteins of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) and ISG56. A2MC2 infection of primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also led to the elevation of the two proteins, but had little cytopathic effect. Furthermore, A2MC2 infection of MARC-145 or PAM cells had no detectable inhibitory effect on the ability of IFN-\u03b1 to induce an antiviral response. Sequencing analysis indicated that A2MC2 was closely related to VR-2332 and Ingelvac PRRS MLV with an identity of 99.8% at the nucleotide level. The identification of this IFN-inducing PRRSV isolate may be beneficial for vaccine development against PRRS.",

Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling.

        "text": "A 7-month-old unvaccinated domestic shorthair cat was presented with a history of inappetence and hypersalivation. Clinical examination revealed fever, gingivitis and oral ulceration. An initial blood sample revealed a severe leukopenia and neutropenia and a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) titre of 1:640; a second titre 10 days later was 1:2,560. A feline calicivirus (FCV) titre was 1:320 and the initial clinical signs and laboratory findings were attributed to a coinfection with FPV and FCV. The cat was treated with interferon omega. A blood sample taken 10 days later revealed a severe thrombocytosis of 3,448 \u00d7 10(9)/L (reference range 200\u2013500 \u00d7 10(9)/L) confirmed by blood smear examination. The platelet count on day 35 was 4,990 \u00d7 10(9)/L. No bone marrow examination was carried out. Two differential diagnoses for an extreme thrombocytosis are a reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a hemic neoplasia that causes a severe and persistent thrombocytosis, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Reactive thrombocytosis is generally mild to moderate and of shorter duration than described here, but an excessive response could have been caused by infection. The influence of additional factors such as an initial thrombocytopenia, age and interferon treatment are not clear but can be speculated on. Although the exact pathophysiology in this case remains unclear, such high, persistent thrombocyte numbers have not been reported in cats in the absence of a neoplastic process.",

This was a prospective, single-center, case series of 250 consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent a Retzius-sparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon between May 2015 and April 2019. Our primary objective was to report post-operative continence outcomes of patients undergoing this technique. Continence was defined as using zero or one precautionary pad per day. Median follow-up was 24.0 months [interquartile range (IQR) 18.0-30.0 months]. Median age and body mass index were 62.0 years (IQR 57.0-67.0) and 29.0 kg/m2 (IQR 26.0-33.0), respectively. Median PSA was 8.22 ng/ml (IQR 5.74-13.31). 84.8% of patients were intermediate risk or high risk pre-operatively, as per AUA/ASTRO/SUO guidelines. 96.0% had Gleason Score 7 or worse disease on final pathologic analysis. Positive margin incidence was 18.1% and 44.4% in patients with pT2 and pT3 disease, respectively, of which 75.4% were unifocal. Immediate continence (i.e., continence achieved within 1 month post-operatively) was achieved in 45.2% of patients. Three-month and 1-year continence rates were 70.0% and 92.0%, respectively. Caucasian patients experienced earlier return of continence (77% versus 65% at 3 months) compared to African American patients. IPSS scores gradually improved from 8.0 pre-operatively to 4.0 1-year later. Median PSA level was 0.01 ng/ml (IQR 0.01-9.01) post-operatively. Retzius-sparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is an oncologically safe surgical technique with excellent short- and long-term continence outcomes.

        "text": "BACKGROUND Evidence exists that during pressure support ventilation (PSV), the addition of an extrinsic (ie, ventilator-generated) breath-to-breath variability (BBV) of breathing pattern improves respiratory function. If BBV is beneficial per se, choosing the PS level that maximizes it could be considered a valid strategy for conventional PSV. In this study, we evaluated the effect of different PS levels on intrinsic BBV in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated subjects to determine whether a significant relationship exists between PS level and BBV magnitude. METHODS Fourteen invasively mechanically ventilated subjects were prospectively studied. PS was adjusted at 20 cm H2O and sequentially reduced to 15, 10, and 5 cm H2O. Arterial blood gas analysis and pressure at 0.1 s after the onset of inspiration (P0.1) were measured at each PS level. Airway and esophageal pressure and air flow were continuously recorded. Peak inspiratory flow, tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency, and pressure-time product (PTP) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. The breathing pattern variability was assessed by the coefficient of variation of the time series of VT, peak inspiratory flow, and breathing frequency from \u223c 60 consecutive breath cycles at each PS level. A general linear model for repeated measures was applied, with PS as an independent factor. A significance level of .05 was considered. RESULTS Despite a large inter-individual difference in all measured variables (P < .001), the coefficient of variation was as low as 30%, and no significant differences in the coefficient of variation of peak inspiratory flow, breathing frequency, and VT between PS levels were observed (P > .15). Additionally, a significant increase in P0.1, PTP, and breathing frequency (P < .01) and a reduction in VT (P < .001) were observed with PS reduction. CONCLUSIONS Despite a significant increase in spontaneous activity with PS reduction, BBV was not influenced by the PS level and was as low as 30% for all evaluated parameters.",

        "text": "Oscillatory activity in the \u00b5-frequency band (8-13 Hz) determines excitability in sensorimotor cortex. In humans, the primary motor cortex (M1) in the two hemispheres shows significant anatomical, connectional, and electrophysiological differences associated with motor dominance. It is currently unclear whether the \u00b5-oscillation phase effects on corticospinal excitability demonstrated previously for the motor-dominant M1 are also different between motor-dominant and motor-non-dominant M1 or, alternatively, are similar to reflect a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest. Here, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the hand representations of the motor-dominant and the motor-non-dominant M1 of 51 healthy right-handed volunteers when electroencephalography indicated a certain \u00b5-oscillation phase (positive peak, negative peak, or random). We determined resting motor threshold (RMT) as a marker of corticospinal excitability in the three \u00b5-phase conditions. RMT differed significantly depending on the pre-stimulus phase of the \u00b5-oscillation in both M1, with highest RMT in the positive-peak condition, and lowest RMT in the negative-peak condition. \u00b5-phase-dependency of RMT correlated directly between the two M1, and interhemispheric differences in \u00b5-phase-dependency were absent.

Here we start a discourse (with a continuation of the dialogue in Ethics of Outbreaks Position Statement. Part 2: Family-Centered Care) concerning the ethics of the provision of medical care, research challenges and behaviors during a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a focus on the proper conduct of clinical or epidemiologic research, clinical trial designs, unregistered medical interventions (including vaccine introduction, devices, pharmaceuticals, who gets treated, vulnerable populations, and methods of data collection), economic losses, and whether there is a duty of health care providers to provide care in such emergencies, and highlighting the need to understand cultural diversity and local communities in these efforts. DESIGN Development of a Society of Critical Care Medicine position statement using literature review and expert consensus from the Society of Critical Care Medicine Ethics committee. The committee had representation from ethics, medical philosophy, critical care, nursing, internal medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology, surgery, and members with international health and military experience. SETTING Provision of therapies for patients who are critically ill or who have the potential of becoming critically ill, and their families, regarding medical therapies and the extent of treatments. POPULATION Critically ill patients and their families affected by a Public Health Emergency of International Concern that need provision of medical therapies. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN RESULTS Interventions by high income countries in a Public Health Emergency of International Concern must always be cognizant of avoiding a paternalistic stance and must understand how families and communities are structured and the regional/local traditions that affect public discourse. Additionally, the obligations, or the lack of obligations, of healthcare providers regarding the treatment of affected individuals and communities must also be acknowledged.

OBJECTIVE To conduct a meta-analysis on sex-based differences in concussion incidence in various sports and to determine the effects of study design (retrospective vs prospective), setting (competition vs practice), and population (university and above vs high school and below) via a meta-regression. DATA SOURCES PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 2000 to January 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting sports-related concussion incidence data for both males and females (age \u226510 years) were included. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 4. METHODS The rate ratio was calculated as the concussion rate in females/males. Data were pooled using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. RESULTS Thirty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Soccer and basketball demonstrated significantly higher incidence of concussions in females compared with males (rate ratio [95% CI], 1.76 [1.43-2.16] and 1.99 [1.56-2.54], respectively; P < 0.01). Sex-based differences in concussion incidence rates for baseball/softball, ice hockey, lacrosse, swimming/diving, and track and field were not statistically significant.

Alterations in proteolytic activity occur during pathological conditions such as cancer. One of the major deregulated classes of proteases in cancer is caspases, the proteolytic initiators and mediators of the apoptotic machinery. The ability to image apoptosis noninvasively in living cells and animal models of cancer can not only provide new insight into the biological basis of the disease but can also be used as a quantitative tool to screen and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies. Optical molecular imaging such as bioluminescence-based genetically engineered biosensors has been developed in our laboratory and exploited to study protease activity in animal models with a high signal to noise. Using the circularly permuted form of firefly luciferase, we have developed a reporter for Caspase 3/7, referred to as Caspase 3/7 GloSensor.

The quality control of newly made secretory proteins relies on the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to segregate and compartmentalize molecules at different folding states. These folding states are communicated by N-glycans present on most secretory proteins. In ER-associated degradation (ERAD), protein molecules that have been identified as terminally misfolded are sent for degradation at the cytosolic proteasomes after being dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. This review will focus on how misfolded glycoprotein molecules are segregated from their properly folded counterparts and targeted to ERAD. The pathway involves compartmentalization, which is intimately linked to differential N-glycan processing.

COVID-19 is a novel type of coronavirus that is defined as SARS-CoV-2, which can be mild or severe in the lungs, causing acute respiratory infection. The disease was first presented in the literature as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in February 2020. The disease spread rapidly and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. There have been approximately 7734185 reported cases, and 412369 reported deaths to date (09/June/2020). As COVID-19 spread in the world and our country, hospitals struggling with this disease have also become risky areas for transmitting the disease. Health workers also have a high risk of viral contamination from direct contact of droplets and surfaces. Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks, coveralls, gloves, face shields and/or goggles, are mandatory. The aim is to spread the flow of cases requiring hospitalization over time, thereby preventing possible accumulation in hospitals. All non-urgent procedures, such as elective surgeries and diagnostic interventions, were significantly affected. The hospitalization procedures were mostly allocated to patients with COVID-19 infection, and surgical operations were postponed. Only urgent surgical cases and oncological surgeries that cannot be postponed were performed during this pandemic process. Patients followed by oncology are immunosuppressed both because of the disease itself and the side effects of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy taken. This makes patients more susceptible to infections, and the prognosis of infections in these patients is worse and more destructive. Cancer patients are almost twice as likely to catch COVID-19 compared to the general population. The choice of surgical procedures and perioperative management of the patients with malignancy has become even more important in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we analyzed the treatment processes of our patients with malignancy that underwent a surgical oncological procedure during this pandemic.",

With the increasing number of recovered patients, more attention should be paid to the follow-up of these patients. METHODS: In the study, 576 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital in Chongqing, China from January 24, 2020, to March 10, 2020 were evaluated by viral nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they could be released from quarantine. Among the 576 patients, 61 patients (10.6%) had positive RT-PCR test results of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyze the demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment of 61 patients. RESULTS: These positive patients were characterized by older age, chronic medical illness and mild conditions. 38 (62.3%) patients who were asymptomatic without abnormalities on chest radiographs were found in the positive with COVID-19. Also, they showed positive results of stool or sputum specimens with negative results of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The median duration of positive result of SARS-CoV-2 was varied from 3 days to 35 days in the patients discharged from hospital with no family member infection. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-site screening of SARS-CoV-2 including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, stool and sputum specimens could be considered to improve the diagnosis, treatment and infection control in patients with COVID-19. Our findings provide the important information and clinical evidence for the improved management of patients recovered from COVID-19.",

However, the signals directing ASC migration into the inflamed CNS are poorly characterized. This study demonstrates that CXCR3 mediates CNS accumulation of ASC during neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis. Expansion of CXCR3-expressing ASC in draining lymph nodes prior to accumulation within the CNS was consistent with their recruitment by sustained expression of CXCR3 ligands during viral persistence. Both total and virus-specific ASC were reduced greater than 80% in the CNS of infected CXCR3(-/-) mice. Similar T cell CNS recruitment and local T cell-dependent antiviral activity further indicated that the ASC migration defect was T cell independent. Furthermore, in contrast to the reduction of ASC in the CNS, neither virus-specific ASC trafficking to bone marrow nor antiviral serum antibody was reduced relative to levels in control mice. Impaired ASC recruitment into the CNS of infected CXCR3(-/-) mice coincided with elevated levels of persisting viral RNA, sustained infectious virus, increased clinical disease, and mortality. These results demonstrate that CXCR3 ligands are indispensable for recruitment of activated ASC into the inflamed CNS and highlight their local protective role during persistent infection.",

DESIGN Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method and were validated using respondent validation. PARTICIPANTS Eight palliative care workers. SETTING Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), the hospital designated to manage all cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. RESULTS Disease containment resulted in isolation, where isolation meant the disruption of connectedness. This disruption of connectedness took place at multiple levels: in the patient himself, between the patient and the family, within the family, between the patient and the health care worker, between the patient and society, and between health care workers. As the nature of the disease was uncertain, prognostication was inaccurate. This created difficulties in helping patients and their families prepare for death. The fear of facing the unknown led to safety-seeking behaviours, which could be overcome by repeated exposure to the feared situation. The process of bereavement was disturbed, as traditional death rituals could not be performed by the family. Informants perceived themselves to be suffering as they suffered the same anxieties, fears and grief as the patient. CONCLUSIONS Dealing with a novel viral epidemic creates spiritual and psychosocial issues similar to those encountered in a palliative care practice.

Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs. Part of the difficulty in identifying CICs may stem from the fact that the CICs studied have been largely derived from cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors. In previous studies, we have reported the enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 is sufficient to induce CAR(+)/mPSCs transformation, which we name CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi). These transformed cells possess cancer initiating and chemoresistance potential, as well as exhibiting remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietins (ANGs) and VEGF, and enhanced angiogenic potential. Moreover, CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi) actively participated in tumor blood vessel formation and triggered a novel angiogenic mechanism, the angiopoietins/Tie2 signaling pathway.

        "text": "It's not news to tell you that the coronavirus, known as COVID-19, is a worldwide pandemic. The initial outbreak of this novel virus in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, first described in December 2019, has since moved on to being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The classic description of COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that manifests with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. However, gastrointestinal (GI) complication of COVID-19 is emerging as well. This was observed with similar viral respiratory illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012. In a recently published, single-center case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, investigators reported that approximately 10% of patients initially presented with GI symptoms, prior to the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms. Common and often very subtle symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, with a less common symptom being nonspecific GI illness. New studies are expanding our understanding of the possible fecal transmission of COVID-19. Assessment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided evidence of the virus in the stool and the oropharynx outside the nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Virus in the stool may be evident on presentation and last throughout the course of illness resolution for up to 12 days after the respiratory virus evidence is gone. In fact, in one of the most recent studies looking at 73 patients, approximately 24% remained positive in their stool for evidence of the virus, though not necessarily infection, after showing negative in respiratory samples. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that after two negative respiratory tests separated by \u2265 24 hours, patients can be dismissed from having transmissibility infection risk for COVID-19. The potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 needs to be strongly considered. Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.",

In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed.

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Infectious Bronchitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease which causes tracheal lesions and also affects the reproductive tract and is responsible for large economic losses to the poultry industry every year. This is due to both mortality (either directly provoked by IBV itself or due to subsequent bacterial infection) and lost egg production. The virus is difficult to control by vaccination, so new methods to curb the impact of the disease need to be sought. Here, we seek to identify genes conferring resistance to this coronavirus, which could help in selective breeding programs to rear chickens which do not succumb to the effects of this disease. METHODS: Whole genome gene expression microarrays were used to analyse the gene expression differences, which occur upon infection of birds with Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV). Tracheal tissue was examined from control and infected birds at 2, 3 and 4 days post-infection in birds known to be either susceptible or resistant to the virus. The host innate immune response was evaluated over these 3 days and differences between the susceptible and resistant lines examined. RESULTS: Genes and biological pathways involved in the early host response to IBV infection were determined andgene expression differences between susceptible and resistant birds were identified. Potential candidate genes for resistance to IBV are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: The early host response to IBV is analysed and potential candidate genes for disease resistance are identified. These putative resistance genes can be used as targets for future genetic and functional studies to prove a causative link with resistance to IBV.

The results provide three lines of evidence suggesting that the spike glycoprotein is different from the other coronavirus proteins: (1) the spike glycoprotein is more sensitive to mutations, this is the current state of the spike glycoprotein, (2) the spike glycoprotein has undergone more mutations in the past, this is the history of spike glycoprotein, and (3) the spike glycoprotein has a bigger potential towards future mutations, this is the future of spike glycoprotein. Furthermore, this study gives a clue on the species susceptibility regarding different proteins. Figure Predictable and unpredictable portions in coronavirus proteins.

It is evident that water, as an essential daily commodity, has long been in a state of emergency in SSAn nations, which is largely attributed to decades of neglect by the successive governments, because it has not been possible to separate the existing bond between water, health, livelihood and the economy. The laudable Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) proposed by the United Nations had yet to achieve the stated objective of improving the standards of living and health conditions of the rural communities in the SSAn region before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This failure has been masked by a sort of delusion in which the people of this region are subjected to the hardship of searching for clean and healthy water in their own ponds, rivers, streams and shallow hand-dug local wells on a continuous basis. Less than 17% of the rural population in all the SSAn communities can access basic hand-washing facilities and sanitation systems.

Twenty-two patients (median age [interquartile range] 63 [59-68] years, 16 males) with COVID-19 were enrolled prospectively. Patients were divided into mild-moderate and severe groups, according to respiratory impairment and clinical management. KL-6 serum concentrations and lymphocyte subset were obtained. Peripheral natural killer (NK) cells/\u00b5L were significantly higher in nonsevere patients than in the severe group (P = .0449) and the best cut-off value was 119 cells/\u00b5L. KL-6 serum concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients than the nonsevere group (P = .0118). Receiver operating characteristic analysis distinguished severe and nonsevere patients according to KL-6 serum levels and the best cut-off value was 406.5 U/mL.

        "text": "RNAi acts as a host immune response against non-self molecules, including viruses. Viruses evolved to neutralize this response by expressing suppressor proteins. In the present study, we investigated dengue virus non structural protein 3 (dvNS3), for its RNAi-suppressor activity in human cell lines. Dengue virus (DV) NS3 reverts the GFP expression in GFP-silenced cell lines. Pull-down assays of dvNS3 revealed that it interacts with the host factor human heat shock cognate 70 (hHSC70). Down-regulation of hHSC70 resulted in accumulation of dengue viral genomic RNA. Also, the interaction of dvNS3 with hHSC70 perturbs the formation of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)-loading complex (RLC), by displacing TRBP (TAR RNA-binding protein) and possibly impairing the downstream activity of miRNAs. Interestingly, some of these miRNAs have earlier been reported to be down-regulated upon DV infection in Huh7 cells. Further studies on the miRNA-mRNA relationship along with mRNA profiling of samples overexpressing dvNS3 revealed up-regulation of TAZ (tafazzin) and SYNGR1 (synaptogyrin 1), known dengue viral host factors (DVHFs). Importantly, overexpression of dvNS3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells resulted in modulation of both mature and precursor miRNAs in human cell lines. Subsequent analysis suggested that dvNS3 induced stage-specific down-regulation of miRNAs. Taken together, these results suggest that dvNS3 affects biogenesis and function of host miRNAs to regulate DVHFs for favouring DV replication.",

We propose different degrees of sectoral integration depending on system types and associated economic efficiency gains to be expected from a One Health approach.

As antigen for detection of SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein (N) showed high sensitivity and strong reactivity with all samples from SARS-CoV patients and cross-reacted with all serum samples from healthy subjects, with either those obtained from China (10 samples) or those obtained from France (38 serum samples), giving then a significant rate of false positives. Specifically, our data indicated that the two subunits, S1 (residues 14 to 760) and S2 (residues 761 to 1190), resulted from the divided spike reacted with all samples from SARS-CoV patients and without any cross-reactivity with any of the healthy serum samples. Consequently, these data revealed the nonspecific nature of N protein in serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV compared with the S1 and S2, where the specificity is of 100%.

At disease diagnosis, 37 of the 94 (39%) patients (group 1) were managed on an outpatient basis whereas the remaining 57 (61%) (group 2) required hospitalization. Choices regarding management strategy were made based on disease severity. In group 1, 41% received antivirals and 76% hydroxychloroquine. Eight percent died and 5% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In group 2, 79% received antivirals and 77% hydroxychloroquine. Forty two percent died and 79% developed ARDS. Overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was 29%. History of ischemic cardiac disease, fever, older age (over age 70) and dyspnea at presentation were associated with the risk of developing ARDS whereas fever, cough and a C-reactive protein higher than 50 mg/l at disease presentation were associated with the risk of death. Thus, in our population of hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we documented a wide range of disease severity.

This is a new situation for most stroke teams that often leads to uncertainty among physicians, nurses, and technicians who are in immediate contact with patients. The situation is made even more complicated by numerous new regulations and protocols that are released in rapid succession. Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols. One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them. It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation. We therefore strongly encourage other hospitals to adopt simulation training to prepare their medical teams for code strokes during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The variations in the virus, and its co\u2010infections with other enteric viruses, have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection. In the current study, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of China during 2015\u20132018. The enteric viruses causing co\u2010infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also analysed. The results indicated that, of the 543 diarrhoea samples, 66.85% (363/543) were positive for PEDV, and co\u2010infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3.58% (13/363) to 81.55% (296/363). Among these enteric viruses, the signs of diarrhoea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co\u2010infections with porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV) and torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV\u20102) (p < .05). The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity. The virulence\u2010determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations, in which S58_S58insQGVN\u2013N135dup\u2013D158_I159del\u2010like mutations were common patterns (97.28%, 143/147). When compared with 2011\u20132014 PEDV strains, the amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N\u2010terminal domain of S1 (S1\u2010NTD), and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, protein homology modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the S1 protein. These data provide a better understanding of the co\u2010infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China.",

        "title": "Can \"presumed consent\" justify the duty to treat infectious diseases? An analysis",
        "text": "BACKGROUND: AIDS, SARS, and the recent epidemics of the avian-flu have all served to remind us the debate over the limits of the moral duty to care. It is important to first consider the question of whether or not the \"duty to treat\" might be subject to contextual constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases, and to analyze the argument that the notion of \"presumed consent\" on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat. METHODS: For this cross-sectional survey, the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in Ankara. All of the 373 participants were given a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 79.6% of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training. Of the participants, 5.2% said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks. It was found that 57% of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk, and 52% of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented. CONCLUSION: If we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the HCW to provide care, we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously, the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession, the near-impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed, and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize, and perhaps even foster, discrimination against patients with certain diseases. Our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list: one-fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training. Furthermore, in terms of the moral duty to provide care, it seems that most HCWs are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand. For all these reasons, the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough, and cannot be used to justify the duty to provide care. It is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of HCWs to provide care, such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that HCWs have a greater ability to provide medical aid.",

Afterward the burst pressure was determined for each artery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Sealing time, failure rate, and burst pressure. RESULT(S) The mean diameter of all arteries sealed did not differ significantly between the two groups (MarSeal 5.40 mm vs. LigaSure 5.35 mm). The mean sealing time was significantly shorter with use of the reusable device (MarSeal 5.2 seconds vs. LigaSure 9.1 seconds). We did not find a significant difference in sealing failure rates between the groups (MarSeal 7.0% vs. LigaSure 9.1%). In addition, analysis of mean burst pressure did not reveal a significant difference between the different devices (MarSeal 429 mm Hg vs. LigaSure 484 mm Hg).

Here, using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and fluorescently tagged PRV, we directly show that depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of host cells significantly reduces PRV entry. Cholesterol depletion did not reduce PRV attachment, but stalled virus particles at the plasma membrane before penetration of the cell. Cholesterol depletion results in destabilization of lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane, which have been shown before to be involved in efficient entry of different viruses. A significant fraction of PRV virions appears to localize juxtaposed to GM1, a lipid raft marker, during entry.

        "text": "BACKGROUND Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare, life-threatening complication of Kawasaki disease (KD). Early recognition and treatment of MAS are very important, but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish MAS from a severe form of KD. DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \"macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\" and \"Kawasaki disease\". RESULTS KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed. CONCLUSIONS The possible existence of MAS should be taken into account when a KD patient shows persistent fever, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, or IVIG resistance. The under-diagnosis of MAS in patients with KD is an important issue to be addressed. Therapeutically, however, there is a possibility of over-treatment of MAS in patients with KD.",

Aims To validate the Pittsburgh response to endovascular therapy (PRE) score in a randomized controlled trial (Trevo2) comparing stent retriever (Trevo) to the Merci device. Methods Trevo2 participants with internal carotid, M1 and M2 middle cerebral artery occlusions with prospectively collected baseline stroke severity (NIHSS), degree of hypodensity (CT ASPECTS), and three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were included. Multivariable regression was used to confirm association between PRE score variables (age, NIHSS, and ASPECTS), medical comorbidities, randomization arm, and reperfusion status (mTICI2B/3) with good outcome (three-month modified Rankin Scale 0-2). Predictive power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for good outcome of pre-treatment prognostic scores (PRE, THRIVE, HIAT2) was compared. Rates of good outcome were compared between successfully reperfused (mTICI2B/3) and non-reperfused (mTICI0-2A) patients across previously identified PRE score risk groups. Results Age, NIHSS, ASPECTS, reperfusion status, and randomization arm were independent predictors of good outcome. PRE score had moderate predictive power (AUC = 0.75) for good outcome and was comparable to other pre-treatment scores. Reperfusion resulted in maximal treatment benefit in patients with PRE score 0-24 (60% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.002) but not in those with PRE \u226550 (11.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.49). Conclusion The PRE score is a validated predictor of functional outcome and a tool for patient selection for endovascular therapy in anterior large vessel occlusion stroke.

Transmission of MERS-CoV at such an event could lead to its rapid worldwide dissemination. Therefore, we studied the frequency of viruses causing influenza-like illnesses (ILI) among participants in a randomised controlled trial at the Hajj 2013. We recruited 1038 pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Australia and Qatar during the first day of Hajj and followed them closely for four days. A nasal swab was collected from each pilgrim who developed ILI. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex RT-PCR. ILI occurred in 112/1038 (11%) pilgrims. Their mean age was 35 years, 49 (44%) were male and 35 (31%) had received the influenza vaccine pre-Hajj. Forty two (38%) pilgrims had laboratory-confirmed viral infections; 28 (25%) rhinovirus, 5 (4%) influenza A, 2 (2%) adenovirus, 2 (2%) human coronavirus OC43/229E, 2 (2%) parainfluenza virus 3, 1 (1%) parainfluenza virus 1, and 2 (2%) dual infections.

The aim of this study was to examine our experience with the use of the uniportal subxiphoid approach in video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) major lung resections and lymph node dissections. METHODS From October 2014 to August 2015, 153 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and benign disease underwent uniportal subxiphoid VATS major lung resections. Patients were placed in a lateral position with 60-70\u00b0 inclination, and a 4- to 5-cm midline median or transverse incision was made below the sternocostal triangle. A 10-mm 30\u00b0 video camera and VATS instruments were used through the same single incision. Perioperative variables and outcomes were collected prospectively and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS Of the 153 patients who underwent surgery with the uniportal subxiphoid VATS approach, 105 had lobectomies and 48 had segmental resections; 135 cases of lung cancer and 18 cases of benign pulmonary disease were noted. Right upper lobectomy was the most common procedure (51%), and left upper lobectomy was the most time-consuming procedure (190 \u00b1 21 min). The mean operating time was 166.9 \u00b1 12.6 min; the average volume of blood loss was 127.5 \u00b1 27.6 ml. In patients with lung cancer, the mean total number of lymph node stations explored was 3.4 \u00b1 0.8. The duration of chest drain use was 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 days. The length of hospital stay was 4.3 \u00b1 0.4 days. Perioperative arrhythmia was the most common complication (13% of cases). Prolonged air leak was the cause of prolonged hospital stay. Five cases were converted to conventional VATS due to technical difficulties, and eight cases were converted to thoracotomy due to major bleeding. Postoperative 30-day mortality was zero and there were no re-admissions. All cases had a R0 complete cancer resection on histology.

Nevertheless, some surgical gynecologic pathologies cannot be postponed. We present a list of the most frequent gynecologic diseases and recommendations on their surgical management during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on expert opinion, current available information, and international scientific society recommendations to support the work of gynecologists worldwide. In brief, any kind of surgical treatment should be scrutinized and postponed if possible. Nonoperative conservative treatment including pharmacological therapies for hormone-sensitive pathologies should be implemented. Health risk assessment by patient history and COVID-19 test before elective surgery are pivotal to protect both patients and healthcare providers. In confirmed COVID-19 patients or highly suspected cases, elective surgery should be postponed until full recovery.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS Parameters describing global and regional LV function were evaluated in 50 subjects using a two-dimensional (2D) steady-state free precession (SSFP) and pre- and postcontrast 3D k-t BLAST techniques. Data analyses included contrast-to-noise ratio analyses, and statistical evaluations included Bland-Altman, Cohen's kappa and analysis of variance techniques. RESULTS Bland-Altman analyses revealed that the ejection fraction computed using the 3D k-t BLAST sequences before (bias+/-2S.D., 2.2+/-8.8) and after contrast administration (bias+/-2S.D., 2.7+/-7.6 mol) was comparable to the 2D SSFP technique. Similar agreement was noted for other global LV parameters. The myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices was better in the 3D k-t BLAST sequence after contrast administration than before. Cohen's kappa values demonstrated good agreement between the sequences for evaluating regional wall motion. CONCLUSIONS 3D k-t BLAST can yield global and regional LV functional parameters comparable to those of the 2D SSFP technique in substantially shorter scan times. In 3D k-t BLAST images, myocardium-to-blood contrast in the apical slices is better after contrast administration.",

A task force of rheumatologists, health professionals and patients, representing 17 European countries updated the recommendations, based on a systematic literature review and expert consensus. Higher level of evidence and new insights into nursing care for patients with CIA were added to the recommendation. Level of agreement was obtained by email voting. The search identified 2609 records, of which 51 (41 papers, 10 abstracts), mostly on rheumatoid arthritis, were included. Based on consensus, the task force formulated three overarching principles and eight recommendations. One recommendation remained unchanged, six were reworded, two were merged and one was reformulated as an overarching principle. Two additional overarching principles were formulated. The overarching principles emphasise the nurse's role as part of a healthcare team, describe the importance of providing evidence-based care and endorse shared decision-making in the nursing consultation with the patient. The recommendations cover the contribution of rheumatology nursing in needs-based patient education, satisfaction with care, timely access to care, disease management, efficiency of care, psychosocial support and the promotion of self-management. The level of agreement among task force members was high (mean 9.7, range 9.6-10.0).

        "title": "Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of 26 Cases of COVID-19 Arising from Patient-to-Patient Transmission in Liaocheng, China",
        "text": "INTRODUCTION: Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China. The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide. Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan. Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients. METHODS: We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province. RESULTS: The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years. The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket. Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission. Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom. The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days. CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively. The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%). Most patients (25/26) required \u22651 treatment. DISCUSSION: In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan. Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people. Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.",

COVID-19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID-19 in the coming days in India using an Auto-regression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richards model. By the end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020.

        "text": "Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterized by respiratory symptoms has become a global pandemic although factors influencing viral RNA clearance remained unclear to inform optimal isolation period and treatment strategies. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, isolation for a minimum of 21 days after onset of illness may be warranted, while the use of antiviral drugs does not enhance viral RNA clearance.",

        "text": "Abstract Objectives Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (\u2018statins\u2019) have been hypothesised to impact COVID-19 severity. However, up till now, no studies investigating this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older adults residing in nursing homes. The objective of this study has been to explore the association of ACEi/ARB and/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older adults residing in nursing homes. Design We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study to analyse the association between ACEi/ARB and/or statin use with clinical outcome of COVID-19. The outcomes were 1) serious COVID-19 defined as long-stay hospital admission or death within 14 days of disease onset, and 2) asymptomatic, i.e. no disease symptoms in the whole study-period while still being PCR diagnosed. Setting and participants A total of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified, residing in one of two Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. Measures Logistic regression models were applied with age, sex, functional status, diabetes and hypertension as covariates. Results We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 (OR 2.91; CI 1.27-6.71), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 2.65; CI 1.13-6.68). Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.24-1.87). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 2.72; CI 0.59-25.1) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.48; CI 0.10-1.97). Conclusions and Implications Our data indicate that statin intake in old, frail adults could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 clinical symptoms. The role of statins and renin-angiotensin system drugs need to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomised clinical trials.",

Ann Surg 2009, 249(4):576-582. BACKGROUND Existing evidence suggests that the transfer of results of randomized controlled trials into clinical practice may be limited. Potential reasons can be attributed to aspects of external validity. The aim of this study is to investigate issues related to the external validity of the INSECT trial. METHODS All participating surgical departments were categorized and the clinical and baseline characteristics of randomized patients were evaluated. In addition, demographic and clinical data of all screened and randomized patients at the Departments of Surgery in Heidelberg and Erlangen were analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-five centers enrolled a total of 625 patients. These centers included eight primary, 11 secondary, and six tertiary care centers. The tertiary care centers enrolled the most patients (n = 237, 38%) followed by the primary care centers (n = 199, 32%) and the secondary care centers (n = 189 patients; 30%). The mean number and baseline data of randomized patients did not differ between the three types of care centers (p = 0.09). Overall, the treatment according to protocol was at least 92%. At the Department of Surgery, University of Heidelberg, 307 patients were screened and 60 out of 130 eligible patients were randomized. There were no differences in demographic and clinical baseline data between included and non-included patients. In Erlangen, 351 patients were screened and 57 out of 106 eligible patients randomized.

        "text": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of self-inflating bag (SIB) vs. T-piece resuscitator (TPR) on PaCO(2) levels, when used for brief manual ventilation during administration of first dose of surfactant. METHODS: Preterm neonates were randomized to receive positive pressure ventilation with either self-inflating bag or T-piece resuscitator during administration of first dose of surfactant. Arterial blood gases were obtained at baseline and 1 h after the intervention. Primary outcome was the mean change in PaCO(2) levels 1 h after the intervention. RESULTS: Eighty neonates were enrolled (40 in each group). The drop in PaCO(2) at 1 h was significantly greater in the self inflating bag group as compared to the T-piece resuscitator group [8.96 \u00b1 9.06 mmHg vs. 1.37 \u00b1 9.06 mmHg, Mean difference = 7.58 mmHg, (95% CI: 3.78 to 11.4); P < 0.01]. The PaCO(2) change was also statistically significant in the subgroup of infants that required only non-invasive ventilation. The need for second dose of surfactant was higher in the self-inflating bag group [77% vs. 55%, RR - 1.41 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.94); P = 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: T-piece resuscitator results in smaller reduction in PaCO(2) levels compared to the self inflating bag, when used for brief manual ventilation during surfactant administration.",

        "text": "INTRODUCTION: Rapid descent in bone mineral density (BMD) and ascent in bone turnover marker (BTM) occur within the short period following denosumab (Dmab) discontinuation. In addition, the incidence of vertebral fracture also rises within the short period. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of sequential therapy using zoledronic acid (ZOL) on any adverse events after Dmab discontinuation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a multicenter retrospective observational study, and the subjects were osteoporosis patients who visited our institutions between 2013 and 2018. We performed sequential therapy using ZOL for 30 patients who had difficulty continuing Dmab, due to physical or social reasons, and investigated the fracture incidence and BMD/BTM changes at 4 time points (at the start of Dmab, the start of ZOL, 6 months after ZOL and 12 months after ZOL). RESULTS: No new vertebral/nonvertebral fractures were observed at each time point after switching from Dmab to ZOL in any of the 30 patients. The BMD/BTM changes were evaluated in 18 of the 30 cases, since all data of lumbar/femoral neck BMDs and TRACP-5b at 4 time points was only available in 18 cases. BMDs significantly increased at each time point compared with that at the start of Dmab. Serum TRACP-5b significantly decreased at each time point compared with that at the start of Dmab. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that sequential therapy using ZOL could suppress the decrease of BMD, and increase of BTM, if the period of Dmab administration was less than 3 years.

        "text": "PM(2.5) and PM(10) could increase the risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in the general public and severely limit the sustainable development in urban areas. Land use regression models are effective in predicting the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants, and have been widely used in many cities in Europe, North America and China. To reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM(2.5) and PM(10) in Xi'an during the heating seasons, the authors established two regression prediction models using PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations from 181 monitoring stations and 87 independent variables. The model results are as follows: for PM(2.5), R(2) = 0.713 and RMSE =8.355 \u03bcg/m(3); for PM(10), R(2) = 0.681 and RMSE = 14.842 \u03bcg/m(3). In addition to the traditional independent variables such as area of green space and road length, the models also include the numbers of pollutant discharging enterprises, restaurants, and bus stations. The prediction results reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM(2.5) and PM(10) in the heating seasons of Xi'an. These results also indicate that the spatial distribution of pollutants is closely related to the layout of industrial land and the location of enterprises that generate air pollution emissions. Green space can mitigate pollution, and the contribution of traffic emission is less than that of industrial emission. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply land use regression models to the Fenwei Plain, a heavily polluted area in China. It provides a scientific foundation for urban planning, land use regulation, air pollution control, and public health policy making. It also establishes a basic model for population exposure assessment, and promotes the sustainability of urban environments.",

Health care experts predict a shortage of N95 FFRs if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment. This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies. Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL). Toxic by-products were also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps.

We examined the course of PCR assays and duration of viral shedding in 23 asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients from the cruise ship who were admitted to our hospital. Among these 23 cases, the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (range, 6-37 days) from initial viral detection. Eight cases (35%) had another positive PCR result after testing negative once. Although the duration of viral shedding was approximately 3 weeks, the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is unclear.

METHODS: A total of 34 patients were divided into two groups, including those who required noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with additional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 11 patients. Clinical features of COVID-19 patients were described and the parameters of clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The rates of the acute cardiac and kidney complications were higher in IMV cases than those in NIV cases. Most patients had lymphocytopenia on admission, with lymphocyte levels dropping progressively on the following days, and the more severe lymphopenia developed in the IMV group. In both groups, T lymphocyte counts were below typical lower limit norms compared to B lymphocytes. On admission, both groups had higher than expected amounts of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), which over time declined more in NIV patients. The prothrombin time was increased and the levels of platelet, hemoglobin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and IL-6 were higher in IMV cases compared with NIV cases during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Data showed that the rates of complications, dynamics of lymphocytopenia, and changes in levels of platelet, hemoglobin, BUN, D-dimer, LDH and IL-6, and prothrombin time in these ICU patients were significantly different between IMV and NIV cases.",

        "text": "Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed an unprecedented threat to humanity with more than eight million infections and 450,000 deaths reported worldwide so far. The spectrum of the disease varies from mild asymptomatic infection to severe disease with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. It is associated with a prothrombotic state and hence there is a risk of thromboembolic complications in critically ill patients, even after recovery. However, the duration of prothrombotic risk after recovery is yet to be determined. We present the case of a 78-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on warfarin who had been recently discharged to a nursing home after recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia and presented to the emergency department a month later with worsening shortness of breath and cough. He was found to have worsening respiratory failure with multiple segmental pulmonary emboli, despite being on warfarin, and supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). He required mechanical ventilation and was started on steroids and therapeutic enoxaparin anticoagulation. This case highlights the risk of delayed thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 infection and the need to identify the subgroup of patients with a higher risk of thromboembolism, such as discharges to nursing homes and those in need of oxygen requirement; and those with underlying comorbid conditions that may require anticoagulation for a longer duration. The role of heparin is being increasingly investigated in patients with COVID-19 infection; however, the role of other anticoagulants such as warfarin is yet to be defined.",

It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future.

Microscopically, the edema and fibrin exudates in the alveoli was the most common findings, especially in the early phase of the disease. The hyaline membrane was almost always present in the lungs of these cases. The organization of intra-alveolar fibrin exudates along with the interstitial fibrosis led to obliteration of alveoli and consolidation of lungs. The desquamation and hyperplasia of alveolar lining cells was also apparent. Foci of haemorrhage and lobular pneumonia, even diffuse fungal infection were frequently seen in these specimens.

OBJECTIVES: To assess consistency between surveillance for respiratory viruses in outpatient and community settings using ILI surveillance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project (IISP) and the Mobile Surveillance for Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) and Influenza\u2010Like Illness in the Community (MoSAIC) Study. METHODS: The Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducts ILI surveillance in 3 primary care clinics in New York City, and MoSAIC conducts community\u2010based ILI/ARI surveillance through text messaging among a cohort of New York City residents. Both systems obtain respiratory specimens from participants with ILI/ARI and test for multiple pathogens. We conducted a retrospective review of ILI cases in IISP and MoSAIC from January 2013 to May 2015 with descriptive analyses of clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: Five\u2010hundred twelve MoSAIC and 669 IISP participants met an ILI criteria (fever with cough or sore throat) and were included. Forty percent of MoSAIC participants sought care; the majority primary care. Pathogens were detected in 63% of MoSAIC and 70% of IISP cases. The relative distribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses detected was similar; however, there were statistically significant differences in the frequency that were not explained by care seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient and community\u2010based surveillance in the one found similar timing and relative distribution of respiratory viruses, but community surveillance in a single neighborhood may not fully capture the variations in ILI etiology that occur more broadly.",

Entry by fusion with the endosomal membrane requires the fusion loop (FL, residues 507\u2013560) of the EBOV surface glycoprotein to undergo a pH-dependent conformational change. To find the pH trigger for this reaction we mutated multiple conserved histidines and charged and uncharged hydrophilic residues in the FL and measured their activity by liposome fusion and cell entry of virus-like particles. The FL location in the membrane was assessed by NMR using soluble and lipid-bound paramagnetic relaxation agents.

The objective of this systematic literature review was to seek to better understand the community-level drivers that might explain the variability in response. METHODS A vigorous systematic cross-disciplinary literature review was undertaken searching thirteen bibliographic databases and a variety of grey sources were screened. The social amplification of risk framework and the risk perception management theoretical models were used to assess evidence and data were synthesised by Narrative review. FINDINGS Sixteen studies meeting the agreed inclusion criteria described eleven different threats ranging from: infectious disease outbreaks to environmental disasters to cancer clusters, affecting two or more communities were identified from medical, psychological, social science and environmental science literature. There was wide heterogeneity between the type and quality of the studies. There was a general absence of theoretical underpinning community responses. Most studies did not report sufficient data to allow an appropriate amount of validity. Very low response rates in particular were common. Potential explanatory drivers suggested included, prior experience and visibility of threat, sociodemographic characteristics, volume and type of media coverage, government reaction and availability of social support. CONCLUSIONS This review confirmed that there are significant differences. Further work is needed to develop theoretical models that apply to the community level and do not assume that a community's response is simply the aggregate of individual level responses.",

        "text": "Acute hypercytokinaemia represents an imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and is believed to be responsible for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure in severe cases of avian (H5N1) influenza. Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza, especially if given within 48 h of infection, it is harder to prevent the resultant hypercytokinaemia from developing if the patient does not seek timely medical assistance. Steroids have been used for many decades in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in which hypercytokinaemia plays a role, such as sepsis and viral infections, including severe acquired respiratory syndromes and avian influenza. However, to date, the results have been mixed. Part of the reason for the discrepancies might be the lack of understanding that low doses are required to prevent mortality in cases of adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency, as defined in the sepsis/shock literature, is a plasma cortisol rise of at least 9 microg dl(-1) following a 250 microg dose of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), or reaching a plasma cortisol concentration of >25 microg dl(-1) following a 1-2 microg dose of ACTH. In addition, in the case of hypercytokinaemia induced by potent viruses, such as H5N1, systemic inflammation-induced, acquired glucocorticoid resistance is likely to be present. Adrenal insufficiency can be overcome, however, with prolonged (7-10 or more days) supraphysiological steroid treatment at a sufficiently high dose to address the excess activation of NF-kappaB, but low enough to avoid immune suppression. This is a much lower dose than has been typically used to treat avian influenza patients. Although steroids cannot be used as a monotherapy in the treatment of avian influenza, there might be a potential role for their use as an adjunct treatment to antiviral therapy if appropriate dosages can be determined. In this paper, likely mechanisms of adrenal insufficiency are discussed, drawing from a broad background of literature sources.",

        "text": "Background. Postobstructive community-acquired pneumonia (PO-CAP) is relatively common in clinical practice. The clinical syndrome is poorly defined, and the role of infection as a cause of the infiltrate is uncertain. We prospectively studied patients with PO-CAP and compared them to a cohort of patients with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (B-CAP). Methods. We prospectively studied patients hospitalized for CAP; 5.4% had PO-CAP, defined as a pulmonary infiltrate occurring distal to an obstructed bronchus. Sputum and blood cultures, viral polymerase chain reaction, urinary antigen tests, and serum procalcitonin (PCT) were done in nearly all cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with PO-CAP were compared to those of patients with B-CAP. Results. In a 2-year period, we identified 30 patients with PO-CAP. Compared to patients with B-CAP, patients with PO-CAP had longer duration of symptoms (median, 14 vs 5 days; P < .001). Weight loss and cavitary lesions were more common (P < .01 for both comparisons) and leukocytosis was less common (P < .01) in patients with PO-CAP. A bacterial pathogen was implicated in only 3 (10%) PO-CAP cases. PCT was <0.25 ng/mL in 19 (63.3%) patients. Although no differences were observed in disease severity or rates of intensive care unit admissions, 30-day mortality was significantly higher in PO-CAP vs B-CAP (40.0% vs 11.7%; P < .01). Conclusions. Although there is substantial overlap, PO-CAP is a clinical entity distinct from B-CAP; a bacterial cause was identified in only 10% of patients. Our study has important implications for the clinical recognition of patients with PO-CAP, the role of microorganisms as etiologic agents, and the use of antibiotic therapy.",

A helpdesk service was established with the goal of providing immediate emotional and communication support to relatives while severe acute respiratory syndrome patients were isolated during the acute phase of the illness. AIM This study describes the results of a rapid assessment of the effectiveness of a helpdesk service designed to meet the immediate needs of relatives of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients in Hong Kong. DESIGN Survey. METHOD Eighty-three respondents, representing about 46.3% of relatives (179), attending the helpdesk on the day of the study were recruited. Service evaluation data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire completed by respondents. RESULTS Nearly 100% of respondents who used the service found the delivery service with on-site counselling useful for alleviating their anxiety. However, about half of these relatives complained of insufficient information regarding the patient's condition and progress. The majority of respondents were satisfied with the service. In describing the most important traits of the service providers, caring and enthusiasm were mentioned most frequently by respondents who stated that they were very satisfied with the service. CONCLUSION The results support the value of the service, and demonstrate that the service is effective in meeting relatives' immediate needs. These needs include information, aid in fulfilling their role as caretaker for the patient (delivering prepared soup) and psychological support. The results suggest that facilitation of visitation of patients by relatives via video conferencing and education of the public on the nature and course of severe acute respiratory syndrome to reduce the social stigma of having a potentially life-threatening disease should be introduced in Hong Kong.

The appropriate screening strategy for IA in these patients remains undefined, particularly in the setting of nosocomial outbreaks. We describe our experience employing chest computed tomography (CT) scans as a screening method for IA. In addition, we comment on antimicrobial prophylaxis in HTRs in the setting of an outbreak. METHODS: Screening CT scans of the chest and serum galactomannan (GM) were performed in HTRs during an outbreak that followed the index case of IA. Abnormal CT findings prompted a diagnostic workup. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for new transplants recipients included intravenous micafungin while hospitalized, followed by outpatient inhaled amphotericin B for up to 3 months. RESULTS: During a 10\u2010month period, five cases of IA were identified among HTRs. Two additional asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with IA among 15 asymptomatic HTRs who underwent screening chest CT scans. Among the five cases of IA in HTRs, two of five (40%) had a partial response and the other three failed voriconazole therapy. Complete response to voriconazole therapy assessed at 12 weeks was achieved in these two asymptomatic HTRs diagnosed via screening CTs. Serum GM was positive only in one of the symptomatic cases. The negative predictive value of CT scans was 100% (95% confidence interval, 71.5%\u2010100%). CONCLUSIONS: In an outbreak setting, screening CT scans of the chest may aid in early detection of asymptomatic HTRs with IA and improve outcome.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) is being scrutinized for repositioning in the treatment and prevention of SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 infection. This antimalarial drug is also chronically used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases. METHODS: By analysing the Portuguese anonymized data on private and public based medical prescriptions we have identified all cases chronically receiving HCQ for the management of diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we have detected all laboratory confirmed cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and all laboratory confirmed negative cases in the Portuguese population (mandatorily registered in a centrally managed database). Cross linking the two sets of data has allowed us to compare the proportion of HCQ chronic treatment (at least 2 grams per month) in laboratory confirmed cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection with laboratory confirmed negative cases. RESULTS: Out of 26,815 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 positive patients, 77 (0.29%) were chronically treated with HCQ, while 1,215 (0.36%) out of 333,489 negative patients were receiving it chronically (P=0.04). After adjustment for age, sex, and chronic treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, the odds ratio of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection for chronic treatment with HCQ has been 0.51 (0.37\u20100.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that chronic treatment with HCQ confer protection against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. Objective: To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. Design: An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. Setting: Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) Participants: 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. Results: The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p=0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p=0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively).

        "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a member of the renin-angiotension system, however, the correlation between ACE2 and prognosis in UCEC (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma) and KIRP (Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma) is not clear. We analyzed the expression levels of ACE2 in the Oncomine and TIMER databases, the correlation between ACE2 and overall survival in the PrognoScan, GEPIA and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases. The correlation between ACE2 and immune infiltration level and the type markers of immune cells was investigated in TIMER database. A prognosis analysis based on the expression levels of ACE2 was further performed in related immune cells subgroup. The ACE2 promoter methylation profile was tested in the UALCAN database. In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4+T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP. And the promoter methylation levels of ACE2 in UCEC and KIRP were significantly reduced. What\u2019s more, we found that the expression of ACE2 decreased in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. In conclusion, ACE2 expression increased significantly in UCEC and KIRP, elevated ACE2 was positively correlated with immune infiltration and prognosis. Moreover, tumor tissues may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients with UCEC and KIRP, which may worsen the prognosis.",

The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate between French districts. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed in certain districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity in the district, therefore to the overwhelming of the healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate and cannot explain the magnitude of the variations in case-fatality rate reported by country by international organizations or information sites. These differences can only be explained by the systems for reporting cases and deaths, which, indeed, vary greatly from country to country, and not attributed to the care or treatment of patients, even during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.",

Before POP-LL, 22 of 28 patients (79%) had a median of 1 (range, 1-5) ERCP, 9 of 28 (32%) underwent a median of 2 (range, 1-3) ESWL sessions, and 5 underwent a median of 1 (range, 1-3) POP-guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy with failed (n=2) or partial (n=3) fragmentation. A median of 2 (range, 1-3) stones sized 15 mm (range, 4-32 mm) were identified in the head (n=9, 32%), neck (n=3, 11%), body (n=9, 32%), tail (n=1, 4%), or multiple sites (n=6, 21%). Technical success occurred in 22 patients (79%) with complete clearance. Partial clearance occurred in 3 (11%). Clinical success at a median of 13 (range, 1-25) months of follow-up was noted in 25 of 28 patients (89%) by improvement in pain (n=25), decreased narcotic use (n=25), or reduced hospitalizations (n=19). Mild adverse events occurred in 8 of 28 (29%). CONCLUSIONS POP-LL is feasible at expert centers in patients with accessible stones. Although intensive endotherapy is required, most patients achieve stone clearance and clinical improvement.",

At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.",

Travel restrictions are often suggested as an efficient way to reduce the spread of a contagious disease that threatens public health, but few papers have studied in depth the effects of travel restrictions. In this study, we investigated what effect different levels of travel restrictions might have on the speed and geographical spread of an outbreak of a disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: We used a stochastic simulation model incorporating survey data of travel patterns between municipalities in Sweden collected over 3 years. We tested scenarios of travel restrictions in which travel over distances >50 km and 20 km would be banned, taking into account different levels of compliance. RESULTS: We found that a ban on journeys >50 km would drastically reduce the speed and geographical spread of outbreaks, even when compliance is < 100%. The result was found to be robust for different rates of intermunicipality transmission intensities. CONCLUSION: This study supports travel restrictions as an effective way to mitigate the effect of a future disease outbreak.",

CASE PRESENTATION A 56-year-old woman presented with recent unsteadiness and paraesthesia in both hands. Fifteen days earlier, she complained of fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Her chest X-ray showed a lobar consolidation and PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; she was admitted due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia.In the first 48 hours of hospitalisation, she started to experience lumbar pain and weakness of the proximal lower extremities, progressing to bilateral facial nerve palsy, oropharyngeal weakness and severe proximal tetraparesis with cervical flexion 2/5 on the MRC scale. A full spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a brainstem and cervical leptomeningeal enhancement. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albumin-cytological dissociation. Microbiological studies on CSF, including SARS-CoV-2, were negative. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, with significant neurological improvement noted over the next 2 weeks.

Being provocative is important because the future may be very unfamiliar and demands an approach of critical thinking, which can best be activated by having to consider the prospective reality of one or more substantially different policy operational environments. The factors that are shaping our future may also be quite disruptive (for example from 1989 to 1994 when the Cold War abruptly ended, the Soviet Union dissolved and the internet was born). Consequently it is essential that any forward preparedness efforts explore a range of plausible options and not immediately discount those that may in today's terms appear unlikely. The author reviews the methods through to the point where scenario parameters are defined, and then switches to observations about how the process can influence and provoke policy formulation.

A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, a large trimeric class I fusion protein that is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly in large quantities. Here, we designed and expressed over 100 structure-guided spike variants based upon a previously determined cryo-EM structure of the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike. Biochemical, biophysical and structural characterization of these variants identified numerous individual substitutions that increased protein yields and stability. The best variant, HexaPro, has six beneficial proline substitutions leading to ~10-fold higher expression than its parental construct and is able to withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaws. A 3.2 \u00c5-resolution cryo-EM structure of HexaPro confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.",

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in feces of patients. We investigated gastrointestinal symptoms and shedding of virus into feces of patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Methods We collected data from 46 patients (median age, 26 years; 46% men) with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (without fever and pneumonia) and prolonged respiratory shedding of SARS-CoV-2, quarantined from April 4, 2020 through April 24, 2020 in Korea. Respiratory specimens included upper respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory specimens (sputum) and were collected twice per week. The median interval between COVID-19 diagnosis to the start of fecal sample collection was 37 days (range, 29\u201341); 213 stool specimens were collected from 46 patients. We used real-time reverse transcription PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory and fecal specimens. Results Gastrointestinal manifestations were observed in 16 of the 46 patients (35%); diarrhea was the most common (15%), followed by abdominal pain (11%), dyspepsia (11%), and nausea (2%). Virus RNA was detected in feces from 2 patients without gastrointestinal symptoms (4%). Mean cycle threshold values from the time of quarantine to the time of fecal collection tended to be lower in patients with virus detected in fecal samples than patients without virus in fecal samples (29.91 vs 33.67 in the first week; 29.47 vs 35.71 in the fifth week, respectively). Shedding of virus into feces persisted until day 50 after diagnosis; fecal samples began to test negative before or at approximately the time that respiratory specimens also began to test negative. Conclusions In an analysis of fecal and respiratory specimens from patients with COVID-19 in quarantine in Korea, we found that the gastrointestinal tract could be a route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 even in patients with asymptomatic or mild disease, with no gastrointestinal symptoms. The viral load of the respiratory specimens appears be related to shedding of the virus into feces in this group of patients.",

To resolve this issue, this study built a multiple mediation model and found government emergency public information as detailed pandemic information and positive risk communication had more important impacts on protective behaviors than rumor refutation and supplies. Moreover, governmental factors could indirectly affect protective behaviors through individual factors such as perceived efficacy, positive emotions, and risk perception.

We have investigated the accuracy of commonly used quantum chemical methods for the description of proton transfer reactions in different environments (gas phase, COSMO, QM/MM) using the proton transfer between the catalytic dyad residues cysteine 145 and histidine 41 of SARS coronavirus main protease as a case study. The test includes thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural properties. The study comprises computationally demanding ab initio approaches (HF, CC2, MP2, SCS-CC2, SCS-MP2, CCSD(T)), popular density functional theories (BLYP, B3LYP, M06-2X), and semiempirical methods (MNDO/d, AM1, RM1, PM3, PM6). The approximated coupled cluster approach LCCSD(T) is taken as a reference method. We find that the robustness of the tested methods with respect to the environment correlates well with the level of theory. As an example HF, CC2, MP2, and their SCS variants show similar errors for gas phase, COSMO, or QM/MM computations. In contrast for semiempirical methods, the errors strongly diversify if one goes from gas phase to COSMO or QM/MM. Particular problems are observed for the recent semiempirical methods PM6 and RM1, which show the best performance for gas phase calculations but possess larger errors in conjunction with COSMO.

Here, we report analysis of the fecal virome of house mice in residential buildings in New York City, NY. Mice were collected at seven sites in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx over a period of 1 year. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of feces revealed 36 viruses from 18 families and 21 genera, including at least 6 novel viruses and 3 novel genera. A representative screen of 15 viruses by PCR confirmed the presence of 13 of these viruses in liver. We identified an uneven distribution of diversity, with several viruses being associated with specific locations. Higher mouse weight was associated with an increase in the number of viruses detected per mouse, after adjusting for site, sex, and length. We found neither genetic footprints to known human viral pathogens nor antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.IMPORTANCE Mice carry a wide range of infectious agents with zoonotic potential. Their proximity to humans in the built environment is therefore a concern for public health. Laboratory mice are also the most common experimental model for investigating the pathobiology of infectious diseases. In this survey of mice trapped in multiple locations within New York City over a period of 1 year, we found a diverse collection of viruses that includes some previously not associated with house mice and others that appear to be novel.

        "text": "Combined biomarker screening is increasingly used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk patients. In adults, the combination of galactomannan (GM) and fungal DNA detection has proven to be beneficial in the diagnosis of IA. Data in purely pediatric cohorts are scarce. Here, we monitored 39 children shortly before and after allogeneic stem cell transplantation twice weekly by use of a commercial GM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a PCR assay based on amplification of the pan-Aspergillus ITS1/5.8S ribosomal operon. In addition, clinical data were recorded and classification of IA was performed according to the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Among the 39 high-risk children, we identified 4 patients (10.3%) with probable and 2 (5.1%) with possible IA. All patients with probable IA were repeatedly positive for both tests (means of 9.5 and 6.8 positive GM and PCR samples, respectively), whereas both possible IA cases were detected by PCR. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 67% and 89% for GM and 100% and 63% for PCR. Positive and negative predictive values were, respectively, 50% and 100% for GM and 27% and 100% for PCR. For the combined testing approach, both values were 100%. The number of positive samples seemed to be lower in patients undergoing antifungal therapy. Sporadically positive tests occurred in 12% (GM) and 42% (PCR) of unclassified patients. In summary, our data show that combined monitoring for GM and fungal DNA also results in a high diagnostic accuracy in pediatric patients.

        "text": "Newer fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin and gemifloxacin have several attributes that make them excellent choices for the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections. In particular, they have excellent intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens. Fluoroquinolones may be used as monotherapy to treat high-risk patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation, but not admission to intensive care. Overall, the newer fluoroquinolones often achieve clinical cure rates in \u226590% of these patients. However, rates may be lower in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this infection should be treated on the basis of anticipated organisms and evaluation of risk factors for specific pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this setting, an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone may be used in combination with an antipseu-domonal \u03b2-lactam. Concerns are now being raised about the widespread use, and possibly misuse, of fluoroquinolones and the emergence of resistance among S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. A number of pharmacokinetic parameters such as the peak concentration of the antibacterial after a dose (C(max)), and the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(24)) and their relationship to pharmacodynamic parameters such as the minimum inhibitory and the mutant prevention concentrations (MIC and MPC, respectively) have been proposed to predict the effect of fluoroquinolones on bacterial killing and the emergence of resistance. Higher C(max)/MIC or AUC(24)/MIC and C(max)/MPC or AUC(24)/MPC ratios, either as a result of dose administration or the susceptibility of the organism, may lead to a better clinical outcome and decrease the emergence of resistance, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiles that are optimised to target low-level resistant minor subpopulations of bacteria that often exist in infections may help preserve fluoroquinolones as a class. To this end, optimising the AUC24/ MPC or Cmax/MPC ratios is important, particularly against S. pneumoniae, in the setting of lower respiratory tract infections. Agents such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin with high ratios against this organism are preferred, and agents such as ciprofloxacin with low ratios should be avoided. For agents such as levofloxacin and gatifloxacin, with intermediate ratios against S. pneumoniae, it may be worthwhile considering alternative dose administration strategies, such as using higher dosages, to eradicate low-level resistant variants. This must, of course, be balanced against the potential of toxicity. Innovative approaches to the use of fluoroquinolones are worth testing in further in vitro experiments as well as in clinical trials.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Antiplatelet resistance is known to be associated with symptomatic ischemic complication after endovascular coil embolization. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the relationship between antiplatelet resistance and clinically silent thromboembolic complications using DWI in patients who underwent coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between October 2011 and May 2013, 58 patients with 62 unruptured aneurysms who were measured for antiplatelet response using VerifyNow assay and underwent elective coil embolization for an unruptured aneurysm with posttreatment DWI were enrolled. Diffusion-positive lesions were classified into 3 groups according to the number of lesions (n=0 [grade 0], n<6 [grade I], and n\u22656 [grade II]). The relationship between antiplatelet resistance and diffusion-positive lesions was analyzed. RESULTS Sixty-two endovascular coiling procedures were performed on 58 patients. Clopidogrel resistance was revealed in 23 patients (39.7%) and diffusion-positive lesions were demonstrated in 28 patients (48.3%); these consisted of 19 (32.8%) grade I and 9 (15.5%) grade II lesions. Clopidogrel resistance was not relevant to the development of any diffusion-positive lesion (grade I and II, P=.789) but was associated with the development of multiple diffusion-positive lesions (grade II, P=.002). In the logistic regression prediction model, clopidogrel resistance showed significant correlation with the development of grade II lesions (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS Multiple diffusion-positive lesions (\u22656 in number) occurred more frequently in patients with clopidogrel resistance after endovascular coiling for unruptured aneurysms.",

        "text": "PURPOSE: Despite the availability of molecular methods, identification of the causative virus in children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has proven difficult as the same viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children. METHODS: Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. Viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 3,505 patients, viruses were identified in 2,424 (69.1%), with the assay revealing a single virus in 1,747 cases (49.8%). While major pathogens in single virus-positive cases differed according to age, human rhinovirus (hRV) was common in patients of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IF), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found to be seasonal pathogens, appearing from fall through winter and spring, whereas hRV and adenovirus (AdV) were detected in every season. Patients with ARIs caused by RSV and hRV were frequently afebrile and more commonly had wheezing compared with patients with other viral ARIs. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was observed in ARIs caused by IF, AdV, and hRV, whereas lymphocyte-dominant inflammation was observed with RSV A, parainfluenza virus, and hMPV. Monocytosis was common with RSV and AdV, whereas eosinophilia was observed with hRV. CONCLUSION: In combination with viral identification, recognition of virus-specific clinical and laboratory patterns will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral ARIs and help us to establish more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

Such ecological overlap, along with our shared evolutionary histories, makes human-nonhuman primate interfaces hot spots for the acquisition and transmission of parasites. In this chapter, we bring to light the importance of human-macaque interfaces in particular as hot spots for infectious disease ecological and epidemiological assessments. We first outline the significance and broader objectives behind research related to the subfield of primate infectious disease ecology and epidemiology. We then reveal how members of the genus Macaca, being among the most socioecologically flexible and invasive of all primate taxa, live under varying degrees of overlap with humans in anthropogenic landscapes. Thus, human-macaque interfaces may favor the bidirectional exchange of parasites. We then review studies that have isolated various types of parasites at human-macaque interfaces, using information from the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD: http://www.mammalparasites.org/). Finally, we elaborate on avenues through which the implementation of both novel conceptual frameworks (e.g., Coupled Systems, One Health) and quantitative network-based approaches (e.g., social and bipartite networks, agent-based modeling) may potentially address some of the critical gaps in our current knowledge of infectious disease ecology at human-primate interfaces.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of the LigaSure vessel closure system during laparoscopic adrenalectomy. METHODS The LigaSure device was used in 32 patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal masses. Adrenalectomy was carried out without the use of clips or sutures for vessel closure. In 1 patient the adrenal tumor had invaded the ipsilateral kidney, so laparoscopic nephrectomy was also carried out during the same operation. In another patient, a renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney had metastasized to the right adrenal gland. Both the kidney and the contralateral adrenal gland were removed laparoscopically during the same operation. RESULTS Adrenal masses had a mean greatest diameter of 3.48 cm (range 2 to 11 cm). Mean operative time was 83.2 minutes (range 30 to 190 min). Mean blood loss was 36.2 mL (range 10 to 140 mL). No conversions to open surgery were necessary. No patients experienced major bleeding intraoperatively or postoperatively. Adrenal tumor types included adrenocortical adenoma (16 patients), pheochromocytoma (13 patients), malignant pheochromocytoma (1 patient), chromophobic carcinoma (1 patient), and metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS For vessel closure during laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the LigaSure device seems to be safe and effective. For patients with conditions such as renal cell carcinoma combined with metastasis to the contralateral adrenal gland, nephrectomy, and contralateral adrenalectomy can be carried out during the same laparoscopic operation.",

This is the first report of the isolation and detailed genetic, biologic, and antigenic characterization of a bovine-like CoV from a giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in a wild-animal park in the United States. CoV particles were detected by immune electron microscopy in fecal samples from three giraffes with mild-to-severe diarrhea. From one of the three giraffe samples, a CoV (GiCoV-OH3) was isolated and successfully adapted to serial passage in human rectal tumor 18 cell cultures. Hemagglutination assays, receptor-destroying enzyme activity, hemagglutination inhibition, and fluorescence focus neutralization tests revealed close biological and antigenic relationships between the GiCoV-OH3 isolate and selected respiratory and enteric bovine CoV (BCoV) strains. When orally inoculated into a BCoV-seronegative gnotobiotic calf, GiCoV-OH3 caused severe diarrhea and virus shedding within 2 to 3 days. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses were performed to assess its genetic relatedness to other CoVs. Molecular characterization confirmed that the new isolate belongs to group 2a of the mammalian CoVs and revealed closer genetic relatedness between GiCoV-OH3 and the enteric BCoVs BCoV-ENT and BCoV-DB2, whereas BCoV-Mebus was more distantly related. Detailed sequence analysis of the GiCoV-OH3 spike gene demonstrated the presence of a deletion in the variable region of the S1 subunit (from amino acid 543 to amino acid 547), which is a region associated with pathogenicity and tissue tropism for other CoVs. The point mutations identified in the structural proteins (by comparing GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, BCoV-DB2, and BCoV-Mebus) were most conserved among GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, and BCoV-DB2, whereas most of the point mutations in the nonstructural proteins were unique to GiCoV-OH3. Our results confirm the existence of a bovine-like CoV transmissible to cattle from wild ruminants, namely, giraffes, but with certain genetic properties different from those of BCoVs.",

The University of Miami Global Institute/Project Medishare (UMGI/PM) established the first field hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, after the earthquake. To characterize injuries and surgical procedures performed by UMGI/PM and assess specialized medical, surgical, and rehabilitation needs, UMGI/PM and CDC conducted a retrospective medical record review of all available inpatient records for the period January 13-May 28, 2010. This report describes the results of that review, which indicated that, during the study period (when a total of 1,369 admissions occurred), injury-related diagnoses were recorded for 581 (42%) admitted patients, of whom 346 (60%) required a surgical procedure. The most common injury diagnoses were fractures/dislocations, wound infections, and head, face, and brain injuries. The most common injury-related surgical procedures were wound debridement/skin grafting, treatment for orthopedic trauma, and surgical amputation. Among patient records with documented injury-related mechanisms, 162 (28%) indicated earthquake-related injuries. Earthquake preparedness planning for densely populated areas in resource-limited settings such as Haiti should account for injury-related medical, surgical, and rehabilitation needs that must be met immediately after the event and during the recovery phase, when altered physical and social environments can contribute to a continued elevated need for inpatient management of injuries.",

        "text": "The effectiveness of screening travellers for signs of infection during times of international disease outbreak is contentious, especially as the reduction of the risk of disease importation can be very small. Border screening typically consists of arriving individuals being thermally scanned for signs of fever and/or completing a survey to declare any possible symptoms, and while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we utilise epidemiological data and Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential success rate of deploying border screening for a range of diseases (including the current COVID-19 pandemic) in varying outbreak scenarios. We negate the issue of testing precision by assuming a perfect test is used; our outputs then represent the best-case scenario. We then use these outputs to briefly explore the types of scenarios where the implementation of border screening could prove most effective. Our models only considers screening implemented at airports, due to air travel being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening has the potential to detect 46.4%, 12.9% and 4.0% of travellers infected with influenza, SARS and ebola respectively, while screening for COVID-19 could potentially detect 12.0% of infected travellers.

Here we present the first nsp1 structure from an alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nsp1. It displays a six-stranded \u03b2-barrel fold with a long alpha helix on the rim of the barrel, a fold shared with SARS-CoV nsp1(13-128). Contrary to previous speculation, the TGEV nsp1 structure suggests that coronavirus nsp1s have a common origin, despite the lack of sequence homology.

Prior studies, primarily in adults, have shown that percutaneous abscess drainage is a safe and effective treatment for this condition; however, the data regarding this procedure and indications in pediatric patients is limited. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to determine the success rate of percutaneous abscess drainage for abscesses related to Crohn disease in pediatric patients with a focus on treatment endpoints that are relevant in the era of biological medical therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 25 cases of patients ages \u226420 years with Crohn disease who underwent percutaneous abscess drainage. Technical success was defined as catheter placement within the abscess with reduction in abscess size on post-treatment imaging. Clinical success was defined as (1) no surgery within 1 year of drainage or (2) surgical resection following drainage with no residual abscess at surgery or on preoperative imaging. Multiple clinical parameters were analyzed for association with treatment success or failure. RESULTS All cases were classified as technical successes. Nineteen cases were classified as clinical successes (76%), including 7 patients (28%) who required no surgery within 1 year of percutaneous drainage and 12 patients (48%) who had elective bowel resection within 1 year. There was a statistically significant association between resumption of immunosuppressive therapy within 8 weeks of drainage and both clinical success (P < 0.01) and avoidance of surgery after 1 year (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective treatment for Crohn disease-related abscesses in pediatric patients.

        "text": "The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, has been declared a global public health emergency. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted \"CellPhoneDB\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.",

        "title": "Influence of Cognitive Functioning on Powered Mobility Device Use: Protocol for a Systematic Review.",
        "text": "BACKGROUND Power mobility devices (PMD) are critical to achieving independent mobility and social participation for many individuals who have trouble walking. Provision of PMDs is complex, with cognitive functioning expressed by clinicians as a major concern. Even if PMD use can be predicted by the level of cognitive functioning, outcome tools used to assess readiness do not consider how cognitive functioning may affect PMD use. OBJECTIVE The specific aims of this review are to identify existing assessments used to assess cognitive functioning and PMD use, classify cognitive functions that are identified within existing assessments related to PMD use, and explore the relationships between cognitive functioning (ie, executive functions and attention) and PMD use. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted using the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO (Ovid), and Web of Science based on the concepts of PMD performance and capacity, and cognitive functioning. To be included, studies must have: a sample of PMD users (inclusive of age and diagnoses), an assessment of cognitive functioning, and an assessment of PMD capacity or performance. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health will be used to classify cognitive functions. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Qualitative and quantitative studies will be analyzed in a complementary manner depending on their designs; a result-based convergent synthesis design will be applied. RESULTS This proposed systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019118957). It was funded by the Quebec Rehabilitation Research Network and approved on February 2019. CONCLUSIONS Results will inform the development of a PMD driving program that aims to enhance cognition. The results of this study will enhance understanding of the influence of cognitive functioning on PMD use and will support the clinical practice in choosing appropriate evaluative tools.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment. METHODS: Embase and MEDLINE were comprehensively searched for original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis. Participant demographics and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients. RESULTS: Women accounted for a significantly larger number of cases of psoriasis compared with men and unreported sex (14 [77.8%] vs 2 [11.1%] vs 2 [11.1%], respectively). In addition, 50% (n = 9) of the patients did not have a history of psoriasis before taking HCQ. Of the 18 patients, 9 (50.0%) experienced de novo psoriasis, 5 (27.8%) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms, and 4 (22.2%) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration. CONCLUSION: HCQ treatment may result in induction, exacerbation, or relapse of psoriasis.

        "text": "Abstract In many applications, it is useful to know the sense and amount of viral RNAs present in a sample. In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays. The assays described may be used to determine the sense and abundance of any viral or host RNA of interest in complex biological specimens.",

        "text": "Objective: Computed Tomography (CT) has an important role to detect lung lesion related to Covide 19. The purpose of this work is to obtain diagnostic findings of Ultra-Low Dose (ULD) chest CT image and compare with routine dose chest CT. Material and Methods: Patients, suspected of Covid 19 infection, were scanned successively with routine dose, and ULD, with 98% or 94% dose reduction, protocols. Axial images of routine and ULD chest CT were evaluated objectively by two expert radiologists and quantitatively by Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and pixel by pixel noise measurement. Results: It was observed that the ULD and routine dose chest CT images could detect Covid 19 related lung lesions in patients with PCR positive test. Also, SNR and pixel noise values were comparable in these protocols. Conclusion: ULD chest CT with 98% dose reduction can be used in non-pandemic situation as a substitute for chest radiograph for screening and follow up. Routine chest CT protocol can be replaced by ULD, with 94% dose reduction, to detect patients suspected with Covid 19 at an early stage and for its follow up.",

        "text": "BACKGROUND The international multicentre registry ECSPECT (European Consensus of Single Port Expertise in Colorectal Treatment) was established to evaluate the general feasibility and safety of single-port colorectal surgery with regard to preoperative risk assessment. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing single-port colorectal surgery were enrolled from 11 European centres between March 2010 and March 2014. Data were analysed to assess patient-, technique- and procedure-dependent parameters. A validated sex-adjusted risk chart was developed for prediction of single-port colorectal surgery-related conversion and complications. RESULTS Some 1769 patients were enrolled, 937 with benign and 832 with malignant conditions. Procedures were completed without additional trocars in 1628 patients (92\u00b70 per cent). Conversion to open surgery was required in 75 patients (4\u00b72 per cent) and was related to male sex and ASA fitness grade exceeding I. Conversions were more frequent in pelvic procedures involving the rectum compared with abdominal procedures (8\u00b71 versus 3\u00b72 per cent; odds ratio 2\u00b769, P < 0\u00b7001). Postoperative complications were observed in a total of 224 patients (12\u00b77 per cent). Independent predictors of complications included male sex (P < 0\u00b7001), higher ASA grade (P = 0\u00b7006) and rectal procedures (P = 0\u00b7002). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0\u00b75 per cent (8 of 1769 patients); three deaths (0\u00b72 per cent; 1 blood loss, 2 leaks) were attributable to surgical causes. CONCLUSION The feasibility and safety, conversion and complication profile demonstrated here provides guidance for patient selection.",

This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new normal future.",
