      "{'content': 'Abstract Reverse transcription requires two replicative template switches, called minus and plus strand strong stop transfer, and can include additional, recombinogenic switches. Donor and acceptor template homology facilitates both replicative and recombinogenic transfers, but homology-independent determinants may also contribute. Here, improved murine leukemia virus-based assays were established and the effects of varying extents of mismatches and complementarity between primer and acceptor template regions were assessed. Template switch accuracy was addressed by examining provirus structures, and efficiency was measured using a competitive titer assay. The results demonstrated that limited mismatch extension occurred readily during both minus and plus strand transfer. A strong bias for correct targeting to the U3/R junction and against use of alternate regions of homology was observed during minus strand transfer. Transfer to the U3/R junction was as accurate with five bases of complementarity as it was with an intact R, and as few as 3nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. In contrast, 12 base recombinogenic acceptors were utilized poorly and no accurate switch was observed when recombination acceptors retained only five bases of complementarity. These findings confirm that murine leukemia virus replicative and recombinogenic template switches differ in homology requirements, and support the notion that factors other than primer–template complementarity may contribute to strong stop acceptor template recognition.', 'score': 24.65625, 'rank': 1, 'document_id': '47okncdw', 'passage_id': 82463, 'document_metadata': {'title': 'Mismatch Extension During Strong Stop Strand Transfer and Minimal Homology Requirements for Replicative Template Switching During Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Replication'}}\n",
      "{'content': 'Genetic recombination is an important mechanism of retrovirus variation and diversity. Size variation in the surface (SU) glycoprotein, characterized by duplication and insertion, has been observed during in vivo infection with several lentiviruses, including bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. These duplication/insertion events are thought to occur through a mechanism of template switching/strand transfer during reverse transcription. Studies of RNA recombination in a number of virus systems indicate that cis-acting sequences can modulate the frequency of template switching/strand transfer. The size variable region of EIAV and BIV SU glycoproteins was examined and an AU-rich region and regions of nucleotide sequence identity that may facilitate template switching/strand transfer were identified. An in vitro strand transfer assay using donor and acceptor templates derived from the size variable region in BIV env detected both precise and imprecise strand transfer products, in addition to full-length products. Sequence analysis of clones obtained from imprecise strand transfer products showed that 87.5% had crossover sites within 10 nt of the crossover site observed in vivo. Mutations in the donor template which altered either the AU-rich region or nucleotide sequence identity dramatically decreased the frequency of imprecise strand transfer. Together, these results suggest that cis-acting elements can modulate non-homologous recombination events during reverse transcription and may contribute to the genetic and biological diversity of lentiviruses in vivo.', 'score': 20.09375, 'rank': 2, 'document_id': '4syiccmk', 'passage_id': 57496, 'document_metadata': {'title': 'Cis-acting sequences may contribute to size variation in the surface glycoprotein of bovine immunodeficiency virus.'}}\n",
      "{'content': \"Molecular mechanisms of RNA recombination were studied in turnip crinkle carmovirus (TCV), which has a uniquely high recombination frequency and non-random crossover site distribution among the recombining TCV-associated satellite RNAs. To test the previously proposed replicase-driven template-switching mechanism for recombination, a partially purified TCV replicase preparation (RdRp) was programed with RNAs resembling the putative in vivo recombination intermediates. Analysis of the in vitro RdRp products revealed efficient generation of 3'-terminal extension products. Initiation of 3'-terminal extension occurred at or close to the base of a hairpin that was a recombination hotspot in vivo. Efficient generation of the 3'-terminal extension products depended on two factors: (i) a hairpin structure in the acceptor RNA region and (ii) a short base-paired region formed between the acceptor RNA and the nascent RNA synthesized from the donor RNA template. The hairpin structure bound to the RdRp, and thus is probably involved in its recruitment. The probable role of the base-paired region is to hold the 3' terminus near the RdRp bound to the hairpin structure to facilitate 3'-terminal extension. These regions were also required for in vivo RNA recombination between TCV-associated sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D, giving crucial and direct support for a replicase-driven template-switching mechanism of RNA recombination.\", 'score': 17.53125, 'rank': 3, 'document_id': 'sfue9fdb', 'passage_id': 81562, 'document_metadata': {'title': 'Dissecting RNA recombination in vitro: role of RNA sequences and the viral replicase.'}}\n"

      "Encoding query: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Effective acute pain management has evolved considerably in recent years and is a primary area of focus in attempts to defend against the opioid epidemic. Persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) has an incidence of up to 30–50% and has negative outcome of quality of life and negative burden on individuals, family, and society. The 2016 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines states that enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) forms an integral part of Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) and is now recommended to use a multimodal opioid-sparing approach for management of postoperative pain. As such, dexmedetomidine is now being used as part of ERAS protocols along with regional nerve blocks and other medications, to create a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced opioid consumption in the Post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RECENT FINDINGS: Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2) agonist, possesses analgesic effects and has a different mechanism of action when compared with opioids. When dexmedetomidine is initiated at the end of a procedure, it has a better hemodynamic stability and pain response than ropivacaine. Dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjuvant in epidurals with local anesthetic sparing effects. Its use during nerve blocks results in reduced postoperative pain. Also, local infiltration of IV dexmedetomidine is associated with earlier discharge from PACU. SUMMARY: Perioperative use of dexmedetomidine has significantly improved postoperative outcomes when used as part of ERAS protocols. An in-depth review of the use of dexmedetomidine in ERAS protocols is presented for clinical anesthesiologist\n",
